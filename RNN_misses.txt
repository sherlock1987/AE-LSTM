1.0 This movie can be described in those 2 words " just unbelievable " . This is the best movie ever made , I just ca nt see why this movie is nt in the top 250 . I also ca n't see why anybody would not love Scarface . Anyways , if you <unk> seen it , it is a must buy .
0.0 Disappointing , predictable film in which a woman ( Mc <unk> ) travels with her daughter from state to state because she ca n't maintain relationships and find happiness . In this genre ' <unk> but here ' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a mother / daughter relationship . With Better acting as well .
1.0 <unk> upon this HBO special late one night , I was absolutely taken by this attractive British " executive transvestite . " I have never laughed so hard over European History or any of the other completely worthwhile point Eddie Izzard made . I laughed so much that I woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house ...
1.0 Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who does n't catch Jerry gets kicked out . The two cats dress in their master 's clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it ! Confused , Tom and Butch whack their master 's rear and all three of them get kicked out .
0.0 .... this movie <unk> too much in its own innocence . It does n't tell a story ; it 's more a big time snooze fest . While the actors are all personable , the story is so trite and goes nowhere . I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma , but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .
1.0 While this is a faithful adaptation , it is much less exciting than Greene 's novel . Also , it 's a bit ridiculous when people say things to Boyer like , " You 're Spanish , are n't <unk> /><br />Still , the movie 's not at all bad , just slow - <unk> /><br / >
0.0 I think it 's a great movie ! ! It 's fun , maybe a little unrealistic , but fun and dramatic ! ! I would like to see it again , if they were showing it in TV ! ! Just 1 question : Are we still talking about the same movie ? ? ?
1.0 if you like gangster type of movies , then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent , Al Pacino his performance is top notch . and the story is classic ! ! 10 / 10 ! ! ! ! Why is n't this movie in the <unk> 250 list ? ?
1.0 I saw " Mystery Men " on my birthday in 1999 while I was away on vacation . When I came back home , I went to see it again . Keep in mind , I was twelve , but at that time it was the coolest movie ever . I even collected the ultra - rare action figures ( I have them all except for the Bowler , which is the hardest to find . They made Mr. Furious , The <unk> , The Blue Raja , The <unk> and Captain Amazing , in case your wondering . There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence ! ) . I 've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine , due mostly to fond childhood memories . It 's not a perfect movie , but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.<br /><br />The story : a bunch of low - level superheroes save the day . This was executed again in the mediocre , direct - to - video " The <unk> " as well . But this is the other end of the spectrum : big budget ( huge budget , almost $ 100 Million I think ) studio comedy . Yes , the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot . But do n't think this as a stupid , special effects - y superhero movie -- it 's a <unk> . They fight a villain named <unk> Frankenstein , people . He has a <unk> , whatever that is ( it 's a doomsday device , he 'll take over the world , yada yada . ) And resident superhero Captain Amazing ( a <unk> <unk> - esque Greg Kinnear , with commercial - product - <unk> on his costume , nice touch ) is kidnapped . Time for the Mystery Men : Mr. Furious ( Ben Stiller , gets mad ) , The <unk> ( William H. Macy , beats people with <unk> ) , The Blue Raja ( Hank Azaria , British , throws <unk> ) , The Bowler ( Janeane <unk> , <unk> ) , Invisible Boy ( Kel Mitchell , guess what he does ) , The <unk> ( the great Paul Reubens , farts ) , and The Sphinx ( Wes Studi , cuts guns in half with his mind , I am not kidding ) . The rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes Geoffrey Rush as <unk> , Lena Olin heavily edited out as <unk> 's bride , and the one and only Tom Waits as a crazy weapons dealer . So ... with Macy , Kinnear , Olin , and Rush there are four Oscar - nominees ( and one winner ) and Tom freakin ' Waits ! It 's not perfect though . It 's overlong and there are some <unk> of <unk> here and there ( The <unk> 's full of <unk> /><br />The dialogue definitely <unk> the physical comedy , which is sometimes lacking ( there 's a guy who farts for his power , case closed ) . The dialogue is definitely a highlight , the <unk> ramblings of the Sphinx , the mixed metaphors of Mr. Furious , etc . It 's downright a funny movie , ( it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let " All Star " by <unk> out into the world . ) < br /><br />Unfortunately , the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have . A sequel was originally planned ( the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from " The <unk> Carrot " comics . The <unk> Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe ) but this did not do well at the box office . It could have been a hard sell , a superhero comedy with the guy from " There 's Something About Mary . " It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as " The Sixth <unk> ended up being the biggest hit for the month of August -- as well as " The Thomas Crown Affair . " Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend , oddly <unk> " and " The Iron Giant . " Critics gave <unk> passable reviews , but it was quickly forgotten . Sadly enough , on Comedy Central 's <unk> of Jerry Stiller , comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that , " I saw ' Mystery Men ' and I fired MY agent . " Ben is then seen to mouth the words , " I should have to . " Do n't listen to him . Give " Mystery Men " a chance .
1.0 This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong . A simple robbery . Pick up some serious change . Get our finances together and everything will be hunky - <unk> . <unk> and pop 's jewelry store ? No problem . <unk> pays for it all . No guns . Nobody gets hurt . Easy money.<br /><br <unk> , more successful ( it would appear ) brother Andy ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) has a few minor problems . <unk> addiction , cocaine <unk> . A wife ( Marisa Tomei ) that  well , he ca n't seem to perform for . His flat belly days long gone . <unk> , sweet , slightly dim - witted younger brother , Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) with a few <unk> problems of his own . Behind in child support <unk> for his daughter , in debt to friends and relatives , not exactly <unk> them in the work of work , etc.<br /><br <unk> Lumet , in this performance at the age of 82 ( ! ) , directs and gets it <unk> percent right , which is hard to do in a thriller . I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes , the <unk> , the cheesy scenes , and the hurry - up ending . Here Lumet makes a thriller like it 's a work of art . Every detail is perfect . The acting is superb . The plot has no holes . The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.<br /><br <unk> of course is excellent . When you do n't have marquee , leading man presence , you have to get by on talent , <unk> and pure concentration . Ethan Hawke , who is no stranger to the sweet , little guy role , adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we do n't know whether to pity him or trash him . Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of <unk> intensity that <unk> his age . And Marisa Tomei , who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity , manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy 's two timing wife . ( But who could blame her ? ) It 's almost a movie reviewer 's <unk> to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars , but if you study this film , as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do , you will notice the kind of excessive ( according to most Hollywood producers ) attention to detail that makes for real art -- the sort of thing that only great artists can do , and indeed can not help but do . ( By the way , I think there were twenty producers on this <unk> , maybe a dozen ; check the credits . ) All I can say in summation is , Way to go Sydney Lumet , author of a slew of excellent films , and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced <unk> . May we all do half so well.<br /><br />Okay , the <unk> percent . It was unlikely that the father ( Albert Finney ) could have followed the <unk> that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail . This is minor , and I wish all thrillers could have so small a <unk> . Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end . We can guess and guess . Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor . Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out , and he just said , " Leave it like that . It really does n't matter . " And I think it does n't . What happens to Hank is not going to be good . He is n't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life . He is the kind of guy who gets a " light " sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of <unk> human being who knows he was n't really a man when he should have been.<br /><br />See this for Sidney Lumet , one of Hollywood 's best , director of The <unk> ( 1964 ) , The <unk> ( 1966 ) , <unk> ( 1973 ) , Dog Day Afternoon ( 1975 ) , Network ( 1976 ) , and many more .
1.0 After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted , urban , turn of the century Australian street , we meet Julie ( Rebecca <unk> ) and Peter ( John Adam ) as they go out house hunting . They manage to get a loan for a <unk> - upper on a posh Sydney street , but it turns out that physical <unk> is not the only problem with their new home . It just may be <unk> /><br <unk> Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average <unk> /><br />The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget , but not wholly <unk> to that <unk> . A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film . The opening " thriller scene " features some <unk> editing . Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there 's not much action . Suspense should be created from staging , not fancy " fix it in the mix " techniques . There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location , the lighting , the fog and such , but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim , cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street , showing their increasing <unk> . The tracking and the cuts need to be slow . The attack needed to be longer , clearer and better blocked . As it stands , the scene has a strong " made for television " feel , and a low budget one at that.<br /><br />After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves . The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror ( 1979 ) , though the budget forces a much <unk> approach . Millar and scriptwriter Tony <unk> effectively create a lot of <unk> creepy scenarios , often dramatic in nature instead of special effects - oriented , such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old <unk> of iron , which had been bizarrely <unk> to an interior wall.<br /><br />For some horror fans , the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama . At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in . But <unk> writes fine , intelligent dialogue . The material is done well enough that it 's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later -- especially if you 've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.<br /><br />Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder , even though the special effects often leave much to be desired , the ideas are good . The performances help create tension . There is n't an abundance of death and destruction in the film -- there 's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares . But neither menace is really the point.<br /><br />The point is human relationships . There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting . The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it . That it 's in a posh neighborhood , and that the relationship is between two successful <unk> , shows that these problems do not only <unk> those who can place blame with some external woe , such as money or health problems . Peter 's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with " normal " work - based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive , scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful . At the same time , we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be . Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown , but finally finds liberation when she <unk> herself from her failing romantic relationship.<br /><br />Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made - for - television <unk> , as a TV movie , this is a pretty good one , with admirable ambitions . Anyone fond of haunted house films , psycho films or horror / thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy . It certainly is n't worth spending $ 30 for a DVD ( that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it ( <unk> in <unk> and handling ) ) , but it 's worth a rental , and it 's definitely worth watching for free .
1.0 It follows <unk> - <unk> and A <unk> AT <unk> , two films that are hard to top . Not that SAPS AT SEA is a bad film - it is the last good comedy ( unless one insists on <unk> or another of the later films ) that Laurel & Hardy made . It 's just that it is a toss - off little film , without the crazy destructive crescendo of <unk> - <unk> or the astounding sight of Stan 's " real " personality in A <unk> AT <unk> to revel in . At 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit , but that actually is not a bad point for it . It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes . It 's just not as special as the other two.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie work in a factory that <unk> horns . I suspect that there was a bit of Chaplin influence in this sequence ( one recalls a similar assembly - line incident in <unk> TIMES only four years earlier ) . Ollie 's nerves finally snap , and he goes on a rampage . He goes home and ( naturally ) his roommate Stan does not help - Stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument ( you 've got it - a <unk> ) . After beating up the poor professor , Ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor / engineer ( Ben Turpin in a nice brief appearance ) , and then faces his doctor ( Jimmy <unk> ) and his nerve <unk> ( a balloon that <unk> as you push air out of Ollie 's stomach ) . <unk> announces that it is a bad case of " <unk> " , and Ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat 's milk . They end up going to a ship but Ollie and Stan know nothing about <unk> - so they plan to sleep on the ship . Unfortunately the goat <unk> the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off . Also unfortunately , on board is Richard Cramer , an escaped dangerous criminal . This is not going to be a peaceful <unk> /><br <unk> AT SEA ( like A <unk> ) could have been three shorts , one at the factory , one at the apartment , and one on the boat . Each would have been a successful short , and they all make a funny film - but the <unk> of the parts together shows . There are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how Turpin 's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and <unk> in the apartment ; the accidental remarks of building manager Charlie Hall when Stan or Ollie runs by him and asks for directions ( " Can you help me find the basement ? " asks Stan - " Certainly , you ca n't miss it - it 's downstairs ! " , says Hall , who realizes what a stupid comment he just made ) ; and Cramer 's <unk> of his two hostage slaves . He calls Ollie " <unk> " and Stan " Daffy " ( an allusion to the Dean Brothers of the St. Louis Cardinal teams of the 1930s - see Dan <unk> 's THE <unk> OF ST . <unk> ) . Cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal ( boot <unk> for spaghetti , for instance ) to get him sick to be overpowered . When he realizes what they have done , he forces them to eat the meal themselves . Their reactions are brilliant.<br /><br <unk> AT SEA is not on par with the top line of Laurel & Hardy films , but it is a good film on the whole , and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career ( 1927 - 1940 ) when they were with Hal Roach . In the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and Roach had serious problems involving production costs ( <unk> <unk> , where Stan was producer on the film ) , artistic problems ( scenes from <unk> MISS were cut <unk> ) , and <unk> arguments ( leading to Ollie appearing with Harry <unk> in <unk> ) . Stan and Ollie hit back with THE <unk> <unk> , wherein the production was not Roach 's but Boris <unk> ' . At last a two picture deal of A <unk> AT <unk> and SAPS AT SEA concluded the arguments and problems - and on a high note the boys left Roach . Unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been .
1.0 Kay Pollak 's 2004 heart - <unk> <unk> <unk> i <unk> As it is in Heaven contains every stereotype of Swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowd - pleaser . It contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics , continuity error - <unk> and for saccharine - <unk> , yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community <unk> . The film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about ' finding one 's own voice ' and ' just doing it despite one 's fear ' , without completely removing the lump from the throats of the <unk> /><br />Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts . Firstly , small films about strangers bringing new life to rural Christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their <unk> . The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze , The Queen of <unk> 's <unk> did it , and Babette 's Feast also comes to mind . Secondly , any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individual / <unk> focused and <unk> world . This film 's <unk> similarity with the likes of The Full Monty , <unk> Off , <unk> Girls and On a <unk> Day shows its <unk> to the formula . But it is a formula with life left in it yet , and this seems to be because people need <unk> message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves.<br /><br />The stranger is burned - out <unk> Daniel <unk> on a quest for self - <unk> . The town he visits , or rather <unk> , is , unbeknownst to the townsfolk , the place of his childhood . He was bullied mercilessly by classmates here , supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck . Here , he takes the job of <unk> / <unk> , despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders . The place is , of course , populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted : the broken - hearted , fair - haired girl so beautiful she nearly glows ; the cellphone - ringing local businessman ; the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse ; the <unk> pastor and his less austere wife , who at first seem right out of Ingmar Bergman . Also present : jealous , uptight spinster ( <unk> ) ( check ) ; <unk> whose soul still sings ( check ) ; elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten ( check ) ; obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say ' <unk> ' ( check ) ; intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good ' A ' ( <unk> /><br <unk> 's film is not all warm <unk> , however . It <unk> from the ' let 's put on a show despite <unk> and moral opposition ' sub - genre . It contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative <unk> . The violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression , but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife <unk> is like this . Similarly , the small town Pastor so closely <unk> to the moralistic , black - wearing super - Protestant stereotype , that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising . His <unk> and <unk> are just there , dangling unrelated to psychological reality . Perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy , a lost son perhaps , glimpsed once over his shoulder , holds the <unk> /><br />Perhaps these holes are functions of the editing , like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted , such as <unk> 's unexplained <unk> in the choir ( twice ) after moralistic outbursts . In fact none of the <unk> in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene . Apart from in some awkward love scenes , the film 's <unk> minutes seldom drag , but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room <unk> /><br />The film remains solid three - star - fare despite the holes that can be picked in it . This is simply because in a world of technology - focused flicks and <unk> self - seeking , any glimpse of human community is , deep down , welcome for anyone , even the cynical .
1.0 " The Garden of Allah " is a prime example of " popular women 's literature " , turn of the <unk> century style , combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic <unk> with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado - masochistic bite of Catholic guilt . Just as Jane Eyre could n't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently <unk> for his sins , or the heroine of " Rebecca " could n't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her <unk> husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife ( and her castle burned down around her ) , or poor <unk> could n't leave well enough alone and had to extract <unk> 's secret at all costs , <unk> , the devout Catholic heroine of this piece of tripe , can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has <unk> his sacred religious vows . Like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the <unk> , this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book : basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one 's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late . The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be <unk> in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in <unk> in the last act . It is Paul <unk> reduced to beauty salon magazine standards . Oh well ... It could have been much worse and it often was ... <br /><br />Without the religious overtones , the film 's plot is that of your basic porn flick : <unk> monk driven mad by <unk> escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the <unk> with a romantic , shapely but naive Catholic heiress before <unk> his monastery , all passion spent , leaving her to clean up his mess . And I really resent another commentator 's comparison with <unk> France 's " <unk> " , a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression , some of which <unk> in <unk> 's opera of the same name , <unk> /><br />But what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism , of course , is the enormous <unk> of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to <unk> , vibrant life . <unk> Technicolor photography that will <unk> us all , a <unk> of worthy character actors ( including one cute dog ) , a music score by Max Steiner that seems determined to accomplish the " composed film " that Michael Powell ( who , ironically , had a bit part in the 1927 silent version ) always dreamed about , <unk> at times on the brink of <unk> but always coming through in splendid <unk> , operatic <unk> , a dream - like atmosphere where material <unk> are no object , characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next , dialog is sparse , vague and suggestive , the art direction is close to celestial , flower arrangements appear in the <unk> <unk> or tent , the heroine 's wardrobe is <unk> and all the male characters are either aristocrats , saints , doomed but horny <unk> , <unk> or <unk> /><br <unk> ... Hollywood ! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable . The bit rate is very high throughout , the colour registration is almost always perfect and the <unk> mono sound truly does justice to Max Steiner 's score and to Boyer 's penultimate <unk> /><br />A historical note on this sort of " women 's subject " : The following year ( 1937 ) , <unk> Duvivier , visibly inspired by " The Garden of Allah " , directed " <unk> de <unk> " , where a very similar clothes - horse butter - <unk> - melt - in - her - mouth heroine ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic <unk> of some impossibly romantic <unk> <unk> villa ) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book . She finds them all in time , only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her <unk> and herself were either misunderstood , <unk> or else had lifelong tragic consequences . It was Duvivier 's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later .
1.0 There have been far too few mainstream films set in post - colonial Africa , and the ones that have are a mixed bunch . This one , with its <unk> pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s , shows the best and worst values of Africa , which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole . It also has shortcomings , given the <unk> influence of western pre - <unk> of Africans and , especially , <unk> /><br />Dr Anansa <unk> , the beautiful African - American wife of the English doctor David <unk> , is captured by Arab slave - traders , along with a teenage <unk> girl and a young boy . The lead slave - trader , Suleiman , is every bit the stage Arab , with his <unk> and sometimes humorous rhetoric , and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on " Carry On Follow that Camel " but are not up the standard this film deserves . Peter Ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script , and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one - dimensional character.<br /><br <unk> the stereotypical theme , all three of Suleiman 's Arab employees are unintelligent and one has <unk> tendencies towards the boy , which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />One of David 's first <unk> of call is the local police officer , a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat . David then meets two stereotypical white ex - <unk> , an Englishman ( Walker , played by Rex Harrison ) and an American ( <unk> , played by William Holden ) . <unk> is a mercenary with " conventional " views on mixed - race relationships , who initially refuses to help unless David provides payment up front . Won over by David 's love for Anansa , and conscious of his own inability to find love , he agrees to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa . They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the <unk> territory - as a result of <unk> 's hesitation and David 's lack of experience with <unk> , his helicopter is shot down but David <unk> /><br />We then see David introduced to Malik ( <unk> <unk> ) , an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance . They find the <unk> girl with a group of <unk> and know they are on the right track to find <unk> /><br />In one of the most heart - <unk> scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not Suleiman 's group , and have no choice but to send their captives to the <unk> they met earlier.<br /><br />Later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and , in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones , he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman 's henchmen . Anansa on her part - and despite the <unk> of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of Suleiman 's two other <unk> /><br />By this time Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave <unk> /><br <unk> , now in no doubt that Anansa is " trouble " , attempts to sell her to an <unk> wealthy Arab prince ( Omar Sharif ) who is corrupt but intelligent . On discovering that Anansa is an American working for the <unk> , the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the <unk> without considering the consequences . The scene where the two men <unk> is one of the best in the film.<br /><br />At the slave market , the young boy is sold to a middle - aged German <unk> , and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered " <unk> " when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch - <unk> <unk> /><br />David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bitter - sweet ending from Malik 's point of view.<br /><br />Ultimately , David and Anansa are re - united , and Malik , whose life is in ruins , can <unk> himself with having seen the task he set himself <unk> /><br />The overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters . <unk> must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting .
0.0 Welcome to Our Town , welcome to your town ? As we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of <unk> America , this three act play is opened before us with the help of " The <unk> Manager " , a visual narrator if you like . After his initial <unk> , we are lead into the homes of two particular families ; The Webb 's and the <unk> /><br />This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . Here we see the everyday lives of some of its <unk> populace of <unk> 's <unk> , New Hampshire , even if there are , too , the <unk> Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a look - in.<br /><br />Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced ; wives cooking , children home - working , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean <unk> - <unk> painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young George ( a young and <unk> William Holden , then aged 22 ) and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . <unk> <unk> reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the <unk> and woes of young adulthood they <unk> step . The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and <unk> /><br />It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . This is n't just about " Our " town , this is moral diction aimed at " Our " souls and how America can better itself if its peoples ' , ( excluding the <unk> , the Irish , the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities ' , and minorities ' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the Americana 's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative ) , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest , decent living . The <unk> of the American Dream with special invitation <unk> /><br />I was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . This was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the Webb 's and the <unk> 's , in the future of the developing country of the USA , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , I thought.<br /><br <unk> from the play by US ' born Thornton Wilder ( <unk> - 1975 ) this Pulitzer Prize winning play , and six Academy Award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes ; Life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the " right sort of people " , you can still leave your back - door <unk> here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . Our Town may just have been " Any Town " , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .
0.0 Disney has now made straight - to - video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features . Two of these were made for their 1991 classic , " Beauty and the Beast " . Well , these ones are n't really sequels , as they are both set in between the events of the first film . The first of these two straight - to - video films was " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " , which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor , but I think that can usually be expected with sequels . However , this second one , " Belle 's Magical World " , is definitely <unk> /><br />The film features three short stories , all of which take place while Belle is in the castle , and the place is under the spell of the <unk> . The first is " The Perfect Word " , where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble , and neither wants to be the first to apologize . The next story is " <unk> 's <unk> " , where <unk> and Lumiere 's fifth anniversary is coming up , and Lumiere is unprepared , so Belle helps him . However , <unk> sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle , and thinks they 're actually in love . The film ends with " The Broken Wing " . In this story , Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing , but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out , as he hates birds ! < br /><br />The plot description I gave is for the original VHS version of Disney 's third " Beauty and the Beast " movie . Apparently , in the DVD version , there is another story added called " Mrs. Potts 's Party " , but I 've only seen the original version . However , since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest , I see no point in watching the special edition . Anyway , the first thing I will say about " Belle 's Magical World " is that the animation is very 2-dimensional compared to what we 're used to from Disney , which would obviously disappoint many people . I did n't like " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " that much , but you certainly ca n't say the same about its animation . I 'm sure the stories in " Belle 's Magical World " could entertain many kids ( mostly younger ones , I think ) , and each story has a moral , so they could also teach them some valuable lessons . However , for adults , the film really does n't have a lot . I personally did n't find any good humour in it , found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring , and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way ( they 're not very well written ) . In " The Perfect Word " , the way Belle says to the Beast , " You 're acting rude ... and foolish ! " is a bit cheesy , and I think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories.<br /><br />By the time this straight - to - video movie first came out , I was around eleven or twelve years old . I do n't know what I would have thought of it at the time , as I had lost interest in Disney by then , and it would be years before I would gain any of that interest back . Even when this movie was first released , I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at . I never saw " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " until a couple months ago , but unlike that film , I never even heard of this one until recently , I think just after seeing the first sequel to Disney 's 1991 hit . Well , as much as I like the theatrical original , I would n't have been missing much if I never became aware of this film 's existence . For little kids , I 'm sure " Belle 's Magical World " can be highly entertaining , and probably somewhat educational with its morals , but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans .
1.0 ( SPOILERS included ) This film surely is the best Amicus production I 've seen so far ( even though I still have quite a few to check out ) . The House that Dripped Blood is a horror - omnibus  an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious , hellish house in the British countryside . A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the <unk> story that connects the separate tales  Peter <unk> 's film wisely does n't pay too much attention to that . It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that , he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before . All four stories in this film are of high quality - level and together , they make a perfect wholesome . High expectations are allowed for this film , since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch ! Yes , the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone ` Psycho '   We 're also marking Peter <unk> 's solid and very professional debut as a director . < br /><br />The four stories  chapters if you will  in the House that Dripped Blood contain a good diversity in topics , but they 're ( almost ) equally chilling and eerie . Number one handles about a horror - author who comes to the house , along with his wife , in order to find inspiration for his new book . This starts out real well , but after a short while , his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination . The idea in this tale is n't exactly original  but it 's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising . The second story stars ( Hammer ) horror - legend Peter Cushing as a retired <unk> . Still haunted by the image of an <unk> and long - lost love , he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her . Cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of Wax <unk> is n't new  this story looks overall fresh and <unk> . This chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock - moments and there 's a constant tense atmosphere . It 's a terrific warm - up for what is arguably the BEST story : number 3 . Another legendary actor in this one , as Christopher Lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father . He 's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world . Not without reason , since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo . Besides great acting by Lee and the remarkable performance of Chloe Franks as the spooky kid , this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere ! The devilish undertones in this story , along with the creepy sound effects of thunder , make this story a must for fans of authentic horror . The fourth and final story , in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire - cloak he wears , is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility , but that the overload of subtle humor more or less <unk> that . There 's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co - star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series ! Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt ! The cult - queen from ` The Vampire Lovers ' certainly is one of the many highlights in the film  her cleavage in particular . < br /><br />No doubt about it  The House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans . I truly believe that , with a bit of mood - settling preparations , this could actually be one of the few movies that 'll <unk> you and leave a big impression . Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be ! Highly recommended . One extra little remark , though : this film may not  repeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with ` The <unk> that Dripped Blood ' . This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80 's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film , except for the title it stole .
1.0 * * * out of * * * * < br /><br <unk> ! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie . It 's like Kalifornia , but it 's different . Remember ? That movie from 1993 which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is " welcomed " by a couple of travelers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way . When I watch a movie , I always like not to know anything at all about the plot , before watching it , because the surprises may get even cooler . That 's how it was with Kalifornia . When I watched it last year for the first time , I never realized it was a suspense movie , so when I found out , I was shocked , and when the movie went on and on , it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat , almost kissing my monitor , so close I was to it ! So , we 're discussing about Dressed To Kill , right ? Before I watched this movie ( today ! ) , I 've only watched 2 others movies from Brian De Palma , so I can say I do n't really know that well his works , but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be . Carrie ( 1976 ) and Mission : Impossible ( 1996 ) . When I watched Carrie on the TV , I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell : this movie is great ! Mission : Impossible also . And today , I watched a third movie from DePalma . < br /><br />Well , Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia . When the movie goes on , it goes completely different than what you 'd expect . I was watching , very curious , the scene of the museum , where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room . You may guess what may have happened there . But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator , the movie went completely on a different path . I was watching the rest of the movie , and I really liked it . However , there are some low points ... Some characters in the movie are completely silent ! Take , for example , the mysterious man from the museum scene . I was always hoping that he could say something but he never did ! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece . Even in the cab scene , where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum , the completely silent man grabs her , pulls her inside the cab , and they start kissing each other . You know , it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the 70 's " El <unk> Del 8 " , where some characters are completely silent . Getting past these low points of the movie , it is actually a great movie , considering the suspense , the characters and the plot . Dennis Franz is cool as detective <unk> ! <unk> me of him as Capt . <unk> Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 ( 1990 ) where he plays almost the same kind of character . < br /><br />Well , concluding this review , the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie ! I do n't know if I really liked that , because I hate imitations ! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma , so it 's not actually an imitation , because after all it was his idea ! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill , so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie . This was , of course , with no doubt , another low point . But if you get past this , you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie , and I assure you that it 's not , by any means , a waste of time watching it .
1.0 The summer has been so full of <unk> and <unk> of films , and not to mention some of the disappointments of those <unk> , that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy . < br /><br />In case you do n't want to read further down the page ( there are n't any spoilers ) , I 'll sum it up here : It 's more mature than Ella Enchanted ( there are some <unk> violent parts , plenty of death , and a handful of scenes with a little blood , not for small children ) , but does n't try to be overly corny or <unk> its bounds . Think of it as a bit more serious , bit more magical Princess Bride , and you 'll be close . < br /><br <unk> /><br />I am , perhaps , not as <unk> a movie goer as others ... Maybe once or twice a month , if I feel active . I 'm also a huge Sci - Fi / Fantasy fan . I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 , and this film is the diamond in the <unk> /><br />By the end here ( August ) , I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I <unk> seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust . Having had my hopes thoroughly <unk> by Transformers for my Fiction addiction , the previews of Stardust seemed appealing , but I was certainly <unk> /><br />As many others here , I was utterly surprised . I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast . Do n't be fooled , it is most definitely a fairy - tale , and it does indeed have witches , magic , and utterly requires suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I found , is that it 's NOT based on anything I 've seen or read in the past 15 years , and it 's actually a really good movie.<br /><br <unk> 90 % of the other movies which seem to <unk> re - appear like <unk> in a side , perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas ? I could read a book this year , and in two years the movie would be out as another " Epic fantasy tale , the likes of <unk> and the rest " so says the <unk> and such and such no <unk> /><br <unk> did n't have me <unk> to my seat because of jam - packed action at every turn , nor was I sweating bullets because of plot - hook after plot - hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom . It did n't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what 's happening on screen ( Transformers , I 'm looking at you ) . It 's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques , nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could 've figured them out in 3rd grade ( boy I hate those ) . < br /><br />I just ... watched . Watched , and enjoyed a refreshingly <unk> storyline unfold before my eyes . Sure , I may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film , but it makes you forget that . It even made my heart <unk> at some parts , but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I 'd gone in.<br /><br />It truly is a gem . After so much <unk> this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations , this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work I 'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money 's <unk> /><br />It 's probably not for everyone , but do yourself a favor ; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone ( Princess Bride , Black <unk> , The Dark Crystal , etc . ) then you should really see this movie . This little diamond is finding its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores , you can trust me on this.<br /><br />Simply wonderful .
1.0 After the <unk> and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986 , I pretty much stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in . And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the <unk> Kids seemed very promising to me , I " retired " and started sleeping in on Saturday <unk> . I only returned to Saturday morning TV in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show . < br /><br />A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up . I was 17 and in high school at the time , but so what ! I loved this show . From what I can recall , this series was a gift to fans I suppose in celebration of Superman 's <unk> birthday that particular year . It had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of John Williams movie score from the Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman movies . I honestly felt that the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team : <unk> <unk> series by Hanna Barbera a few years before . Sadly , Danny Dark was not back as Superman , but I felt Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdy like the Chris Reeve version . After hearing him as Reed Richards / Mr . Fantastic on the 90 's Fantastic Four , I could still see this version of Superman in my mind . <unk> <unk> as Lois Lane . LOL ! What a rhyme . She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I guess she took it upon herself to do Lois . Memories of the <unk> lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast . Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor , who on the <unk> was formerly <unk> . Perry White is none other than former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross , who on <unk> was Gorilla <unk> and <unk> in the Super Powers shows . And Lex Luthor , now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than <unk> voice <unk> , Michael Bell , whom I know best as <unk> and the <unk> as well as many other characters on many other series . < br /><br />I felt this series was a combination of the movie Superman along with the post crisis John Byrne re envision of Superman , with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon , Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman . The Bruce <unk> series and Lois and Clark would also do this . Unfortunately , we never saw <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> . Other than Luthor , we saw only the <unk> and we did see General <unk> . I especially enjoyed that one episode with Wonder Woman , who was voiced over by <unk> Ward who played her on the Super Powers Team as well . < br /><br />The episodes were smashing and I also enjoyed Clark 's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short little segment , Superman 's Family <unk> . < br /><br />The only two things I did n't like . It only lasted one season . And after Wonder Woman 's guest spot , I was hoping Batman would turn up voiced over by Adam West ( Still thinking about the Super Powers Team episodes I guess ) . I also hoped for it because on the <unk> episode , the Metropolis baseball team was <unk> against the Gotham <unk> . < br /><br />Every popular Super Hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare . For <unk> , I feel it 's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as Amazing Friends . For the Incredible Hulk , it 's the 1982 cartoon . For the Fantastic Four , it 's the 1978 series with <unk> the Robot . For Batman , it 's the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by <unk> featuring <unk> . But for Superman , the <unk> series is this one . < br /><br <unk> books and documentaries never cover or mention it . This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release . All in all , this 1988 version of Superman is well .... Super ! !
1.0 SPOILER ALERT ! This Movie , Zero Day , <unk> An Inside To The Lives Of Two Students , Andre And Calvin , Who Feel <unk> And Hatred For Anyone And Anything <unk> With There <unk> /><br />They Go On A Series Of Self - Thought Out " <unk> " All Leading Up To The <unk> Mission , Which Is Zero Day .

And The Ending Is No Different Than Any Other Movie About The Attack , They go And Kill Many Of Their <unk> Students In The End.<br /><br />I Have Seen A lot Of Movies On This Attack , And This Movie By Far Is My Favorite , And Most <unk> . It <unk> The Viewer And Inside Look To The Lives Of These Two <unk> Who Hate Life , And Honestly It <unk> The Viewer Some What Of An <unk> , And A <unk> On The Horrible <unk> /><br />Being Only 7 When The Events Played Out , I Never Knew The <unk> Of The <unk> , Until My English Class Was <unk> An <unk> Or Story On A <unk> Moment In Our Generation . Well I Knew Everyone Was Going To Pick The Twin Towers , But I Wanted To Be Different , Because Of Course The Twin Towers Was <unk> And Very <unk> , But I Did n't Think It Was The Right Choice For Me Because there was Really No Way Of <unk> To that Because , I Was Only In The 3rd Grade And I Had No Idea What It All <unk> . But The <unk> Did Leave And <unk> . I Remember The <unk> , The Sky <unk> Of The School , And The Hurt And Terror In The Eyes Of <unk> Of <unk> /><br />This Movie Is A <unk> , Down To Earth , And <unk> <unk> , And I Would <unk> It To Anyone .
0.0 It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie . That , to me and many others , is one of the greatest film noirs ever made . <unk> this is simply a shortened made - for - TV film and that most people had trashed it , I did n't expect much , but you ca n't help but compare this with the ' 44 film . Scene after scene , I found myself comparing what I was looking at it , and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray , Barbara Stanwyck , Edward G. Robinson and others . Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar and Lee J. <unk> /><br />When it was all over , I found it was n't as bad as I had expected but it 's no match for the 1944 original . The two main areas in which this made - for - TV film was n't as good were ( 1 ) the electricity between the two leads was missing and ( 2 ) being only 90 minutes , they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot , characters and chemistry between those leads . Crenna and Eggar were flat , and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as " Walter Neff " and " Phyllis Dietrichson , " <unk> /><br />Where this re - make held its own was in the other characters , such as " Barton Keyes " and " Edward Norton . " Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton , head of the insurance company . It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed , so the houses , cars , <unk> , <unk> machines , etc . , were all early ' 70s instead of mid ' 40s . Otherwise , the storyline was very similar , just <unk> /><br />However , one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film .
1.0 I am surprised at IMDb 's low rating of this movie . With all due respect , its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor . They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills , a bigger budget , and more gore.<br /><br />The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . It is not , nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one . It is a psychological thriller . It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . <unk> 's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie . All the other negative reviews does n't make much sense . It 's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a <unk> very rare these <unk> is something bad and not worth it.<br /><br />I will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and did n't make sense . Martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning . The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing , we sympathize with this cold - blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film 's direction and writing.<br /><br />I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 's range on originality alone . I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ <unk> aka smart <unk> since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy 's <unk> /><br />Kudos to the acting as well . For such a low budget film , you are amazed that this movie did n't hit your local cinema with the great direction , writing , and acting . Please do n't be fooled by the rating by IMDb . This movie is worth it . I actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .
1.0 Three teenage girls in an incomplete <unk> relation . The base of the triangle is barely there . At the <unk> is Marie , a serious , short and lean tomboy with a <unk> - like facial structure . Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite : <unk> , chubby -- I dare say fat -- and <unk> for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter . Because of her <unk> , boys do n't seem interested and it pains her.<br /><br />The other leg of the <unk> is a beautiful " <unk> fatale " blonde vamp . She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level . Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool . Marie <unk> herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized <unk> as an argument . The vamp has a reputation of being a whore , making out with any young male that <unk> around her . Marie is not <unk> out by that reputation . Put a stress on <unk> /><br />The first half is set up . We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls . Eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the <unk> - <unk> relations among the three . That 's when unexpected things start to happen.<br /><br />It is a trademark of French films to drop <unk> of wisdom on the viewer . This one is no exception . Here it is about ceilings and the dying . See the film to learn more.<br /><br />The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is <unk> . That women - only sport is a metaphor for a girl 's life : pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath . A number of scenes drive this point : elegant moves and smiles for the public , legs kicking <unk> underwater . The title in French is also suggestive : " <unk> " , or <unk> , suggest an individual having to <unk> many pressures simultaneously .
1.0 An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people 's buttons . , the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct . The story 's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer , Gerard ( Krabbe ) , with a seriously twisted sense of imagination . Verhoeven offers up < br /><br <unk> has an example of everything wrong with the modern man . He 's <unk> , delusional , unable to control his urges , afraid to commit to < br /><br <unk> relationships , and utterly apathetic about life in general . As the character himself states at one point , he is a professional liar , unable to recall the truth.<br /><br />The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ , and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction . He chases off < br /><br <unk> man ( a boyfriend presumably ) , then chases another at a train station . Later , at a lecture , he meets a woman who seems to want to help him , or < br /><br <unk> she has more nefarious plans .. She quickly captures Gerard in her web , enticing him with sex and money , having plenty of both . She 's also got < br /><br <unk> , like three dead husbands . Is she lonely , and genuinely looking for someone to <unk> - or is she a deadly black widow , <unk> Gerard to his < br /><br <unk> ? Will <unk> be the 4th man she kills ? The woman is Christine ( Soutendijk ) , and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she 's up to.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie , with a lot of sex and intrigue . It 's similar to <unk> < em > Basic <unk> > , but has a lot more depth , and is certainly more shocking . There 's a lot of very strong gay content , which may make some viewers squirm . Highly recommended for fans of intelligent < br /><br <unk> thrillers , or anyone looking for something entirely new .
1.0 Tim Meadows has to be the most underrated of SNL 's recent cast members . What initially was a low - brow look at a sleazy <unk> develops into a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute run , albeit , still low - brow . Do n't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or Oscar - worthy performances . Walk into it expecting brilliant silliness with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best - making the audience laugh.<br /><br <unk> " The Ladies ' Man " Phelps is a naive , likable radio sex show host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the <unk> . As a gifted Ladies Man , he lays waste to the wives of countless <unk> who 've <unk> together in order to hunt him down . The director does an inspired job of guiding the actors on a comedic <unk> which makes up completely for the lack of plot development . How much plot would one expect from an SNL skit ? While some scenes are a little off the mark , for the most part , Meadows ' one liners and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone squarely . For instance , in one scene , Meadows compares himself to Mother Theresa , but for <unk> ' . Sure it 's crass , but do n't we all in the privacy of our homes get a chuckle out of his advice to an entire city for " <unk> it in the butt " ? In another scene , immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead , he suddenly remembers the name of his would be <unk> , a woman he slept with years ago . He stands up in front of the woman who 's obviously fallen for him and proclaims that " The Ladies ' Man is back , " to her obvious <unk> /><br />Billy Dee Williams hits the ball out of the park as the bartender / narrator . Will Ferrell , the repressed homosexual , rounds out solid performances.<br /><br />See this movie if you 're into adult humor . If not , stay away with extreme prejudice .
0.0 This is a review of ' Freddy Mercury The Untold Story , ' theatrical release , Chicago <unk> . Film Festival , 2007 One of the <unk> , uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen . If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV , I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a <unk> worthy documentary feature . Even as a made - for - TV documentary , the sentimental piano <unk> accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous , pseudo - literary narration rang more true of a <unk> bed <unk> . The only redeeming aspects of this " The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury " -- or , <unk> , was it " The Untold Story of Princess Diana " are the original concert , video and TV footage -- <unk> Freddy Mercury and Queen . <unk> interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights , such as : " He was a free spirit , " ( really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ... ) <unk> those Freddy <unk> , by Brian May or <unk> <unk> that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury 's complex life and character . And ... what up with the Harry Potter - like boarding school segments ? How did the interview with the first girl - crush ( " ... who now works in a travel agency " ) and members of Freddy 's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury ? <unk> <unk> of his personal life , his sexuality , his artistic style and growth , Queen , the band remain unexplored . These filmmakers do n't ask a single , provocative question , nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject , instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend , who does n't deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can <unk> off to on a Sunday night .
1.0 Tony Arzenta , a <unk> hit - man or professional killer , decides to leave the business , and his former employers do not agree . In terms of content , this highly enjoyable action movie does n't have one ; in terms of sheer amusement , it is <unk> is very melodramatic , violent , quite brutal , the car chases are notable . " Arzenta " is an unpretentious , yet very likable <unk> better than the current <unk> trash that gets the same label . It comes from Delon 's rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the ' 70s . It carefully uses Delon 's tough guy persona , belonging to the gallery of bad - ass thugs that he made in his youth . < br /><br />I enjoyed very much the fact that Delon made this film , that he had a role in a good <unk> flick.<br /><br />The score is very fine , with a good introductory <unk> felt that gusto that the Italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work , where the musical art has an important part.<br /><br />In Tony <unk> Big <unk> No Way Out the very appealing Erika Blanc ( 31 years in ' 73 ) appears as an unnamed hooker . Meanwhile , Arzenta 's girlfriend , Sandra , is played by Carla <unk> ( a starlet that practically left the movies after ' <unk> /><br <unk> " is interestingly <unk> ambitious visual conception , some <unk> peculiar angles . The movie was directed by the prolific <unk> Tessari , the one who made also Zorro ( the Delon <unk> to mention that these two films , Tony Arzenta ( 1973 ) and Zorro , are very unlike . The first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie -- the second is a lighthearted comedy , more <unk> to a spoof , though remarkably coherent and <unk> made . <unk> Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang ( <unk> of Satan , The <unk> Butterfly , ¡ Viva La <unk> ... <unk> ! , Tough Guys ( <unk> Express ( 1976 ) , etc ..
1.0 As of this writing John Carpenter 's ' Halloween ' is nearing it 's 30th anniversary . It has since spawned 7 sequels , a remake , a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do those ' Top 10 <unk> Movies ' lists it 's always on there . That 's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $ <unk> and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent . I could go on and on , but the big question here is : How does the film hold up today ? And all I can say to that is , fantastically ! < br /><br />Pros : A simple , but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood . An unforgettable and <unk> - inducing score by director / co - writer John Carpenter and Alan <unk> . Great cinematography . <unk> direction by Carpenter who keeps the suspense high , gets some great shots , and is careful not to show too much of his villain . Good performances from the then mostly unknown cast . A good sense of humor . Michael Myers is one scary , evil guy . A lot of eerie moments that 'll stay with you . The pace is slow , but steady and never drags . Unlike most other slasher films , this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body <unk> /><br />Cons : Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then . Many of the goofs really stand out . < br /><br />Final thoughts : I want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series . I know that 's not a popular opinion , but it 's really how I feel . Despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs . And just because it 's been remade for a new generation does n't mean it 'll be forgotten . No way , no <unk> /><br />My rating : <unk>
1.0 This movie has to be my favorite of all time . Its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people ( Charlie Sheen , I <unk> believe it was a real snuff film . This was an exercise in visual effects , and does n't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . Movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood . There still are movie makers who still ca n't get fake blood to look like the real thing . There is no rape scene because that was n't the point of making the film . Have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking . Although i 'm sure there are some <unk> porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . But since they probably suck at making films , they probably would n't be able to pull it off . The movie " <unk> <unk> " has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall <unk> /><br />Its too bad that a movie ca n't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an <unk> or NC-17 rating . I 'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his Hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an R rating ... or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these <unk> /><br />Watch <unk> of Death or More than <unk> <unk> if you want no <unk> real footage ( accident & crime scenes / footage ) . Do n't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . That would be like someone saying the <unk> Super Mario Brothers sucks because the <unk> has better graphics .
1.0 No , this hilariously horrible 70 's made - for - TV horror <unk> is n't about a deadly <unk> possessed <unk> cake . Still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable <unk> ray refuse reaches a breathtaking <unk> of absolute , <unk> silliness and <unk> that 's quite tasty in a so - execrable - it's - downright - awesome sort of way . Richard Crenna , looking haggard and possibly <unk> , and Yvette <unk> , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in " Jackson County <unk> , " <unk> portray a disgustingly nice and respectable <unk> couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped <unk> when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . Pretty soon <unk> and her two <unk> cutesy kids Kim Richards and <unk> <unk> ( the psychic alien <unk> from the Disney " Witch Mountain " pictures ) are <unk> a crude <unk> drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . Boy , now does n't that sound really scary and disturbing ? Well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ai n't , but it sure is funny , thanks to Curtis ( " Night Tide " ) Harrington 's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish ( not so ) special effects , an almost painfully <unk> plot , and a game cast that struggles <unk> with the absurd story ( besides the leads , both <unk> <unk> and <unk> Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor <unk> has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American <unk> ) . Favorite scene : the malicious <unk> <unk> puts the <unk> on Crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning <unk> blade . While stuck - up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to <unk> .
0.0 It 's not the most well made slasher movies of all time , but for what it is , it 's pretty amusing . The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad . I have to be honest , if you do n't follow the bands that are featured in this film , you wo nt find this film as funny as those who do . I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour , in between playing to <unk> kids and <unk> ' with friends backstage ... it 's not made to be taken seriously . It 's <unk> cheese at it 's punk best and with over 100 kills , most of which are ultra gory , it 's a fun movie to have friends over to watch , drink and be merry !
0.0 Tony Scott directs a thriller sports flick that should attract even the non - sports fan . And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn slow . Well perk up ! On the outside he appears to be a disgruntled <unk> De Niro ) while on the inside he is a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan . Along comes a new <unk> <unk> <unk> savior from the <unk> . Our salesman <unk> a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst <unk> in his career and the Giants are feared to <unk> along with him . De Niro is terror personified . Snipes seems very natural as the <unk> . Other <unk> in the cast are : the still attractive Ellen Barkin , John Leguizamo , Benicio Del Toro and Patti <unk> . You are a free agent ... so enjoy . Violence and very strong language is to be expected and you get your <unk> worth .
1.0 In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly good ! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had <unk> /><br />However , after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . With only one ' toilet humour ' gag , Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a good film are all there ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film stands <unk> /><br />Sure , you are n't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !
1.0 This was different , that 's for sure . Just look at the cast ! Talk about <unk> /><br />William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars , although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight , in this farce about superhero - <unk> . The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of " Pee Wee Herman " <unk> /><br />There is lots of humor , garish colors and no lulls . It 's a pretty entertaining , lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters , all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman , Batman , Spiderman , you name . They have talents in strange areas , however , that the real heroes do n't ( and do n't want to ! ) . It 's silly , but you know that going on.<br /><br />It 's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity . It 's a long movie for one so hectic , so taking a break here and there is okay . The language was tame so kids could enjoy this , too . In fact , I do n't recall any swearing in here , except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering , " What a dumb , f --- ing movie . " I thought it was fun two hours but I 'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks .
1.0 Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of <unk> without a British accent , he more than makes up for it with his over - the - top and larger - than - life interpretation of Ebenezer <unk> /><br <unk> effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie 's end . As Scott stands before a large window , sunlight casts a glowing <unk> over him ; all you can see is his silhouette . <unk> by Scott 's voice , a ponderous <unk> , the effect is <unk> ... much like Marlon Brando 's first scene in <unk> NOW . " The Horror , " indeed ! < br /><br />However , as they say , the very thing that works for you can also work against you . Because Scott displays such gleeful <unk> throughout the movie , it proves infectious . To put it another way , the " before " Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the " after , " even though he really should n't be . It 's what you might call the " Doctor Smith " effect , since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies ( stage and screen <unk> /><br />Actually , I myself do n't consider Scott 's glib rage a liability . But other " Christmas Carol " purists might . See the film and judge for yourselves .
1.0 There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood <unk> /><br />A friend , sends me movies now and again , as a surprise , it 's <unk> /><br />I turned it on and could n't stop watching , it is a drama , but with a odd twist . Imagine if Romeo , as in <unk> , had a super power . It is sad and poetic at the same time . Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist . Granted it 's not perfect , but nothing ever is . You know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . I do n't want to see a remake , it is too cool as is , the Hollywood system would , as usual , mess it up . Acting is top notch all around . Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . Kudos to all involved , and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic . <unk> /><br />If you can find i , watch it .
1.0 Superb . I had initially thought that given Amrita <unk> 's communist leanings and Dr <unk> 's nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when I read the novel I was surprised to find that it was <unk> /><br />Kudos to <unk> <unk> for not being pseudo - <unk> and to Dr <unk> to be objective . This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way . <unk> of any war are women as some poet said and this movie <unk> it . It is also a sad commentary on Hindu psyche as they ca n't stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu Brother who can only burn the fields of his <unk> . On the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place . I think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they Will become legal owners of the houses and thus new <unk> . will not be able to ask them to return the houses . This apart one has to salute the courage of characters of <unk> and her <unk> they are two simple village girls <unk> of outside world and risk <unk> by trying to come back after being <unk> . Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in <unk> /><br />No wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women .
1.0 I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw . It was a cool fun movie . Dolph looked superbly cool on the <unk> . He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . He is now in a pretty good shape . The story was ok and the other actors were also passable . I would n't call this movie his best but its still a good movie.<br /><br />But it also had its share of Problems . The first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . They should 've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way . Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing . I do nt know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom . The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers . There should 've been more bad guys . Last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget . Overall the movie was a good Movie . I enjoyed it . I would recommend others to watch it . P.S. Now u r a DEAD beat cop . ( Some One - liners were also <unk> /><br / >
1.0 I watched this film sort of by accident , having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD . The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning , which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later , the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies . But Soylent Green is in a whole other league . I bet this is one of Tarantino 's favourites . There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I 've never seen anything like before . Heston casually getting into bed with the " furniture " while discussing something else completely unrelated ! A whole crowd of people being <unk> up by a fleet of mechanical <unk> ! A priest taking confession and being shot by the <unk> . Ok maybe that 's been done since - but there are n't many films that are so consistently original like this . And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson ? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever , or what ? Luckily , I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare . Then I watched it again , and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile . A very nice script - and some great sets too . Just when you thought you 'd seen everything . . .
1.0 I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too did n't have high hopes for it . I figured it was another " You Got <unk> " type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting . I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the <unk> and picked this . To my surprise the acting was n't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good . The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got <unk> is absolutely ridiculous . Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you do n't spend too much . I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it . When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones . Go see the movie and judge for yourself . Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released.<br /><br <unk> The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating . Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 , a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 .
1.0 Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that were n't exactly true to character , this was Classic H : LOTS . The characters , outside of Mike Giardello ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , were true to form , and the reunion scenes of <unk> ( Andre <unk> ) and <unk> ( Kyle <unk> ) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen.<br /><br <unk> : The Movie " aka " Life <unk> " is a fan flick , but stands on its own as well as any <unk> episode of the series . Fontana , <unk> and <unk> did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of " the best damn show on television " together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it . True to " Homicide " form , there were no happy endings , such is life . That 's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie - cutter cop shows left on television . Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers <unk> /><br / > * * I call myself a " <unk> Maniac " if for no other reason than to keep my co - workers in a <unk> mood . * *
1.0 This is by far my favorite film of all time . That 's mainly because it 's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics ( such as <unk> and female <unk> ) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch . Nothing seems to be off - limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly <unk> the viewer . However , I do n't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone . Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance . Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it . The other cast members do a fine job as well.<br /><br />Have you noticed that this movie has n't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters ? Have you ever wondered why ? The obvious reason is that it just does n't fit today 's political atmosphere . It seems quite ironic to me that some <unk> channels now carry softcore porn ( that 's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn ) but will not carry a mainstream movie like " Love Crimes " . Sadly , even though this movie is only 11 years old , it could probably not be made today.<br /><br / >
1.0 Well it was a nice surprise after all . its trailer did not predict a good film at all , it was even a bit misleading . Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise , well written , sardonic and funny . Less real though , I do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such <unk> towards everything that his current company stands for . One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again . The ending of the film , during the showing of <unk> <unk> , was too corny , cliché and quite disappointing . And of course a guy like Pegg 's character would not last past his first week in a <unk> New York magazine like this . I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox , here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo . And by the way , I do not see why she is the " sex symbol " of the year , I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine .
1.0 Whilst reading through the comments left for this show , I could n't help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will . The thing about Kerching ! is that it 's a children 's show , FOR CHILDREN so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy , forced , and probably stupid . I even found one person saying the sets were stupid , but I remember as an eight year old wondering why Taj had <unk> <unk> <unk> on his wall , and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine ( they did n't ) . Yeah , it can be annoying , the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair , but as a kids show , I rate it 10/10 . Compared to the stuff they air in its place today , well , lets just say I wish it 'd be re - aired . DVD release , anyone ?
1.0 " Saving Grace " is never <unk> funny , but it delivers quite a few good laughs and I enjoyed it to a significant degree . Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress , and does a good job at portraying widower Grace , who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts . The supporting cast also does a fine job . French actor <unk> <unk> has a funny little role . The premise alone is appealing . The idea of an over - the - hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough . And the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then . Of course , there are flat moments , like one where two elderly women mistaken Grace 's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work . That was a mindless gag that did n't quite take off . The film 's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull , but I got enough laughs to give this English import a recommendation . < br /><br />My score : 7 ( out of 10 )
1.0 I only wish that Return of the Jedi , have been directed by somebody else , I mean , there is far too much <unk> scenes , completely unnecessary . Besides this time our heroes look like different people : Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo , Luke looks boring , Darth Vader is not as evil as before , and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just ca n't hate it.<br /><br <unk> SPOILERS <unk> Jabba the <unk> <unk> The <unk> <unk> attack sequence . <unk> emperor ( now that 's evil ) <unk> The <unk> chase at the <unk> forest . <unk> Last Battle . <unk> Dark side seduction scene . <unk> return of Anakin to the good side of the force . <unk> And the last <unk> /><br />Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes . If some scenes would have been cut , and another director was hired , this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 , but still is extraordinary . 9 out of 10 .
1.0 Yes ... I'm going with the 1 - 0 on this and here 's why . In the last few years , I have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late <unk> because the movies were that easy to forget . Then I stumble upon " Nothing " . <unk> interesting , was n't expecting much though . I was wrong . This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch . Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember , but not over complex to the point of missing the joke . I do n't want to remark on any of the actual scenes , because I do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once . With more and more pointless concepts coming into movies ( you know , like killer military jets and " fresh " remakes that are ruining old classics ) , This movie will make you happy to say it 's OK to laugh at " Nothing " .
1.0 I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever . When I watched Valentine , I was amazed at how great the story line actually was . It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all . The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning . Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor , and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring , but overall it was non - stop entertaining and suspenseful . It had a mind - twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it does n't deserve all the crap it gets . I recommend this movie to watch anytime , but especially on Valentine 's Day because it 's sure to give you a ton of chills . Oh , and do n't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating , please , DON'T ...
0.0 If Alien , Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea , add a lot of sugar and you 'll get this one down . The film begins in jolly old England around <unk> and then jumps to present day California . Our hero Carver ( Dean Cain ) is the new Security Chief and Military <unk> for a Science Lab 400 feet underground . He arrives ( Carver is also a helicopter pilot ) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it 's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone . Is it a Dinosaur or what ? As with the above movies , all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off . The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a " direct to video " movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for . But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before . Again , do n't go in with high expectations and you 'll be ok .
1.0 This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but when I see this film , I do n't think about that wonderful TV series . I believe this was a surprisingly good early 40 's horror flick , with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a <unk> year old public domain horror movie . I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff , including his wife who requires fluid from the <unk> of young would - be brides , an old <unk> , and her two bizarre sons , one a giant idiot , the other a comical <unk> Rossitto from 1932 's Freaks ) . I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter , who is kind of a stereotype , but still fun to watch . My only problem with this otherwise decent film is it 's plot , even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie . I do n't want to spoil any of this film , so go out and rent it , or , better yet , buy it for a couple of bucks .
1.0 I ca n't believe I am just now seeing this film -- I think perhaps I thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated , and I avoided <unk> for the same reason -- just as I have yet to see Schindler 's List -- I do n't want to be " entertained " by other peoples ' pain , not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be.<br /><br />So I guess the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites . The black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their " husbands " . It was painful to watch , but everyone redeemed himself in the end , and the acting was phenomenal ! I could n't believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35 ! And I adore Whoopi to start with - she was amazing . I 'm so glad I was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running The Color Purple .
0.0 The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father <unk> and a bunch of <unk> . Christopher Lee ( who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved ) is Father <unk> and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine . The cast are not too bad , though most have now retired from acting . The film has terrible sound effects ( mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems ) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky , for instance , for what feels like hours at a time . Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world - is - doomed sort of way and the production is adequate . Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie ; <unk> Band ; Writer Frank Ray <unk> and Charles Band 's assistant <unk> Burton . Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .
1.0 Taking a break from his escapist run in the early ' 80s , Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker 's " The Color Purple " , about about the desperate existence of an African - American woman in the 1930s . Watching Goldberg play Celie , it 's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like " Sister Act " . This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no , make that SHOULD BE - part of the <unk> in Black Studies and Women 's Studies . There 's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that 's ever been on screen ( you 'll know it when you see it ) . I ca n't believe that this did n't win a single Oscar ; it may be Spielberg 's second best movie behind " Schindler 's List " ( maybe even tied with it ) . Also starring Danny Glover , Adolph Caesar , Margaret Avery , Oprah Winfrey , Willard E. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Laurence Fishburne .
1.0 This movie is more Lupin then most , especially coming from <unk> . Other then the bad dub , it is n't bad.<br /><br />The first hour is a lot like the Comic ( which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on ) . Lupin 's trying to get a huge treasure . <unk> 's using Lupin 's weakness to women to try to get something out of it . The last bit is n't that bad , he 's with another women , but of course <unk> 's still him number one.<br /><br />A lot of the other Lupin movies are more Family with cuss words then Lupin . Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised ( I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie ) . It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits ( they make it a little mushy ) but overall , it is n't a bad film . Good enough to be one of the few I 'd watch again of the Lupin III movies .
1.0 <unk> 30 minutes of pure holiday terror . Okay , so it 's not that scary . But it sure is fun.<br /><br />The Crypt <unk> ( John <unk> ) tales a tale of holiday FEAR , giving us all Christmas <unk> ... <unk> That is . <unk> . You should really be careful what you <unk> Santa for . Have a Scary Christmas and a Happy New Fear . Okay I 'll stop.<br /><br />Okay , so in the story , a greedy wife ( Best <unk> in the world , Mary Ellen Trainor ) kills her husband ( Marshall Bell , the coach who gets towel whipped to death in <unk> 2 ) for the money . BUT , her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a Santa suit ( Larry " Dr. <unk> " Drake ) comes her way.<br /><br />If you look it up on YouTube , you can watch it for free , but most of you have already seen this ( my third viewing ) . But if you have n't seen it , I suggest you do .
1.0 This is Jackie Chan 's best film , and my personal favourite . After the disappointing U.S made ' The Protector ' directed by James <unk> , Jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into Hong Kong . This is also probably <unk> most violent movie , with the audience cringing at the bone breaking <unk> /><br />The action is fast and furious , Jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design . <unk> were broken and blood <unk> in the process of making this film as you 'll see in the credits.<br /><br />The script is a simple cops and robbers affair , nothing special , after all it was written around the action . I must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing , but it should n't put you off too much.<br /><br />So , get the lads round , crack open the beers and enjoy . By the way , the film was nicknamed ' Glass Story ' by the stunt crew . Why ? I 'll let you find out for yourself ! !
1.0 < br /><br />If you like rap or hip - hop , watch this movie , although it 's funny if you do n't get the references , as a straight comedy.<br /><br <unk> seen much of the much hyped CB4 , but what I did see did n't have the heart that this little <unk> has.<br /><br <unk> heard from the people involved since , which is a surprise . The film is very similar to Spinal Tap , which is no bad thing , and I think a lot of the dialogue , while priceless in Tap is funnier here , probably because I 'm more into rap than rock <unk> days , so my own judgment does cloud that point.<br /><br />The rap songs are funny as hell , and it 's basically spot the reference for most of the film , not all of them are in - your - face , which means the physical comedy and the one - liners get priority over the take - <unk> /><br />Great fun , one to watch twice if there ever was a movie .
1.0 " Perhaps we can arrange a meet . " " Where are you now ? " " I 'm sitting in my office . " " I doubt that . " " Why would you doubt that ? " " If you were in your office right now we 'd be having this conversation face - to - face . " < br /><br <unk> remains street tough , and elusive . Only his inhuman <unk> leads the film a little too far into fantasy . Conversation is macho , to the point with only <unk> of Bond type <unk> humour . Its all about the action.<br /><br />The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy <unk> so well . A scene set in <unk> with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect . There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.<br /><br />If the shaky cam does n't annoy you too much , enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going .
1.0 The H.G. Wells Classic has had several <unk> . The <unk> ' <unk> Version and the classic 53 ' version But only this one stays completely true to the book . Nothing is changed nothing is <unk> /><br />Originally Released as a <unk> film . The director Re - Cut the film down to <unk> of pure excellence . Its got a chapter by chapter <unk> of the novels pages that " Wells would be <unk> Of " The story is as everyone remembers . Martians <unk> the Earth with <unk> containing an army of <unk> walking War <unk> . The people of 19th century earth are ill - prepared to <unk> the alien forces and fight back with <unk> and guns who mes shells bound right off the <unk> and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of <unk> on earth.<br /><br />The Film is an excellent accomplishment for director Timothy Hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 Million budget . Today B - Movies have larger budgets .
1.0 Indian Directors have it tough , They have to compete with movies like " <unk> " where 11 <unk> , <unk> males defend their village and half of them are <unk> idiots . " <unk> " , a hapless , <unk> <unk> foreign return drinking to oblivion , with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one 's feelings or sentiments - alas they live in an <unk> squalor of red tapestry and <unk> . But to make a good movie , you have to tight - rope walk to appease the <unk> who are the <unk> <unk> who are mesmerized with <unk> skirts and <unk> - <unk> fights preferably involving a <unk> " Bollywood " leading actor who is marginally handsome . So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of <unk> village head who in own words " defending his Village " this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar ( <unk> ) . Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him <unk> and mock the <unk> when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him , meanwhile his daughter is bathing his <unk> . This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India . Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films . The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with <unk> thrown in for the <unk> without whom movies wo n't sell , a sad but true state of affairs . <unk> this changes better for " Bollywood " . All said and done this is one good Movie .
1.0 There was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer . For starters , the casting did n't seem right . Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in " 24 " and the preview did n't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience . Eva Longoria appeared out of place , and the rest did n't seem very interesting.<br /><br />When the film finally ended , I was not completely <unk> for I had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better , had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development . We have seen threats of this type before , and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers . As an audience , we do n't want to sit through the same old story again . We want to see something different , be thrilled and entertained.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the casting . From Kim Basinger 's delicious first lady . She carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable . Michael Douglas has been and done that before . Unfortunately , the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate . Sutherland <unk> his " 24 " tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen , and Eva does a passable job , as the <unk> /><br />Don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ( " North by Northwest " and " The Fugitive " come to mind ) . Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be . It 's o.k .
1.0 This film is an absolute classic for camp . That is why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic . Everyone knows the story . Scientist keeps his girlfriend 's head alive in a <unk> pan in his basement while he <unk> town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks . Finally he finds a real <unk> body with a scar - faced chick 's head on top . The severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the <unk> comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant 's remaining " good " arm ( his other is not right from a scientist 's earlier failure ) , and the whole place burns down.<br /><br />The movie scared us so much as kids that my friend would n't go into his basement for a year after seeing it . As kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four . Only one of those scary movies was really any good ( the Original " The <unk> /><br />I had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers . Its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies ( complete with porno sound track ) scares the hell out of innocent children , while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing . I could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while I 'd rather go to the Dentist than watch " Chicago " again.<br /><br <unk> is the most I can give it , because its entertainment value is mere luck . The film , as cinema , is a disaster .
0.0 I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago , but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be yet another failure of <unk> western and Asian arts . Overall , the scene is beautiful , but after restless emphasis on <unk> - oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them . The excessive cherry blossom was , frankly , overdone . It 's probably the cultural difference of perception here : the ultimate beauty is not the showy type , as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over <unk> pumpkin in the movie . < br /><br />Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws . As a Taiwanese , I have no doubt the actress are great . An actor / actress can play any kind of role when he / she can look like it . <unk> Li is great , but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style . All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN . <unk> <unk> , one of my <unk> actress , did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese . Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate , feminine characteristics of Japanese women , with which I ca n't agree more . These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha , let alone the two Chinese and one <unk> actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.<br /><br <unk> is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences . But it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the Oscar for best costume , best director or best picture .
1.0 Just as the new BSG was n't what fans of the original series were expecting , Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting ( for the most part ) . It is a very interesting , if not somewhat self - involved show , or at least the pilot is.<br /><br />If you 're looking for the big CGI thrills of the ( new ) BSG , you 'll be sorely disappointed . If you liked the drama , you 'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with.<br /><br />The storyline does examine on how the Cylons were developed , why Adama hates them and the origins of a <unk> society . The writers also manage to tackle humans ' playing <unk> ) ' and the creation or re - creation of ' human ' life . It will be interesting to see how this plays out.<br /><br />I found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others , but all in all it was promising . A small part of me wishes ( or hopes ) there might be some minor <unk> of BSG in there ( aside from the back story I mentioned ) , but that would probably <unk> the storyline too much . Like BSG , I 'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me , but it 's way too early to <unk> /><br />It would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series , but I 'm willing to give it a chance . Overall , I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before ' throwing in the ( proverbial ) towel ' .
0.0 I LOVE Don Knotts , let me just say that up - front ! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does , which is portray a nervous , lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority . He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming , the <unk> <unk> , but the film is pretty dull , really , even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films . It 's still worth watching but really it 's a film that is best enjoyed by children . I 'd categorize it as 100 % family - friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.<br /><br />As with all of Knotts ' films , there 's a great cast of beloved character actors and you ca n't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky , open - mouthed stares , no matter how old and jaded you are.<br /><br />From an adult perspective , one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings , the hope , the optimism , the future ! And I was surprised at how suave and <unk> Leslie <unk> was back then . Only complaint about the story is Roy 's love interest , a rather threadbare , unlikeable woman who ca n't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you 're like me , you 'll be hoping that he gives her the shove - off at the end . Beware -- you 'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching , it 's that catchy .
1.0 I liked Top Gun . It held my interest . Predictable plot , decent character development and story line . It is pretty similar to High Noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain . This movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents . Also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles . Denver Pyle was a good looking man in his younger days . John <unk> , Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles . Sterling Hayden did the best that he could with poor material . It is hard to imagine him as a <unk> . Laura , played by Karen Booth , was a nauseating character . She seemed <unk> that two men may have been fighting over her . Ugh . Finally , How can people travel without luggage ? Especially women .
1.0 Return To the Lost World was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 version of The Lost <unk> /><br />In this sequel , the same five people , lead by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land . Gomez has something to do with this . They manage to defeat the <unk> and the plateau is saved , much to the delight of the <unk> /><br />Like in The Lost World , what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T - Rex and <unk> /><br />John <unk> - Davies and David Warner reprise their roles as Challenger and <unk> and three of the other actors are also back.<br /><br />Despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs , I enjoyed Return to the Lost <unk> /><br />Rating : 3 stars out of 5 .
1.0 I do n't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey . He has never been a very interesting film actor . < br /><br />The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit . Alfred Molina and Patrick <unk> make an unusual comic duo , definitely not stock types . Although one ca n't say their characters are well developed that does n't make them any less funny.<br /><br />The version I saw was on <unk> and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog , so that was certainly not a problem . The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity . < br /><br />A very underrated movie , judging by the unusually low score IMDb members have given it . I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least . A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting .
1.0 " I like cheap perfume better ; it does n't last as long ... " - Ralph Meeker 's convict character ( Lawson ) tells this to Barbara Stanwyck 's Helen character , after he gets a <unk> of the perfume that she picked out w / her husband in <unk> ... ! This line cracked me up , and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive , because a cheap perfume - loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run ! I agree with some of the other comments posted about Helen 's attraction to Lawson . Even though her narration states that she wants Lawson to be put away , she did seem attracted to his fiery nature , and that passion he stirred up in her would n't likely wash away with the tide !
1.0 Ed Harris 's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence , that is , he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it , and that includes the formidable Sean Connery . The movie , which is more than a bit sanctimonious , comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is <unk> by the attorney for another convict . It is breathtaking , a master class in artistic <unk> /><br />The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable , as is <unk> , but the story itself packs no wallop . The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and <unk> by white law enforcement officers . This is the engine which drives the story , right or wrong , and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end.<br /><br />Still , worth watching to see Harris in action .
1.0 This is a rip - roaring British comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired . Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception , particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan . Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in ' Streets of San Francisco ' . I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this film though , appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on , particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst <unk> his clothes . One thing does concern me though , could someone please tell me why i can not purchase this on either DVD or VHS format in the UK , could someone please assist ?
1.0 After watching this film last night on Sundance , I realized that much of <unk> 's style was first done in this film . Here we have many of the same elements of the <unk> series , especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural . Instead of the cursed videotape , we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film . In fact , the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in <unk> to mind . The only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through <unk> 's later films . The final scenes are quite chilling , with a bit of a nod to Murnau , what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room , reminds me <unk> of < br /><br <unk> . A chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a <unk> .
1.0 I 've just watch 2 films of Pang brothers , The Eye and One take only . When I watched The Eye , I was kind of disappointed about this two guys , who I had heard good words about them before . That film ( The Eye ) has a really bad script , especially the ending ( childish , cliche and too <unk> in my opinion ) , but its still good in photography and experimental images . So I decided to see One take only and I did n't disappointed again . Still great photography , stunning image , MTV - style editing , cool music and this time , the story has a lot of indie spirit , logical and beautiful , you 'll see some tiny plot holes , but it does n't cause any trouble with the storyline . The only problem about this film is I get a bad DVD .
1.0 <unk> skipping over everything from the coup in Cuba to his undercover entry into Bolivia , part two of Soderbergh 's portrayal of Che Guevara is that of the tragic hero . As with Che  Part One , this rather rambling guerrilla warfare <unk> through the colourful mountains of Bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy , so why was the film ( and particularly Benicio Del Toro 's performance ) so loudly praised at <unk> /><br />James <unk> , for instance , called it , a work of art that 's , " not just the story of a revolutionary , " but , " a revolution in and of itself . " The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw called it a " flawed masterpiece . " I return to my original contention for Part One  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure . And in an age when there is a <unk> of poor hero role - models , could it not be <unk> to see a strongly honourable one , even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life ? This is the psychological hero <unk> by the great Scottish <unk> , Thomas Carlyle , in his seminal book , Heroes and Hero <unk> . Heroes can be real or imaginary ( or somewhere in - between ) . But should genuinely inspire us to higher goals , a higher purpose . Compare this with the unrealistic ' heroes ' of standard Western storytelling : where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely - believable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention . Real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not Lost Ark dare - <unk> or James Bond super - toys . They rise , and <unk> others to rise , to be the best that they can be . In Part One , Che succeeds . In Part Two , he fails . It is not for want of moral courage but since a ) not all good plans can succeed and b ) being human , mistakes are <unk> /><br <unk> 's intellectual clarity is flawed when he <unk> conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed . It is a serious <unk> /><br <unk> in the mountains from La Paz , the colours are breathtaking . There is an air of mise - en - scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in Che - Part One ( The U.S. would not allow Soderbergh to film in Cuba . ) Visual treats are heightened by <unk> natural light and the extreme <unk> and realism offered with groundbreaking RED cameras . This is a high performance digital <unk> camera with the quality of 35 mm film and the convenience of pure digital . <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , the package <unk> a mere 9 lbs . " <unk> with RED is like hearing the Beatles for the first time , " says Soderbergh . " RED sees the way I see . . . so organic , so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light . " If Che had stopped with the successful Cuban revolution it would have <unk> him with an almost mystical <unk> . That he fails in Bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered , not the political triumph . Critics will say  and with some justification - that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin - pot <unk> . His development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves ( and have since been used for <unk> /><br />But for all its <unk> , the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension . We stumble from one <unk> to another , knowing that he will eventually meet his death . I found myself <unk> at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter . But the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of Guevara 's ex - comrades to coach actors on the <unk> of the Bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement . It might not be top - flight entertainment , but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history.<br /><br />There is also another very important point in the Che ' hero ' figure here . It 's about failure . That if you try your utmost , even if you fail , your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage . One could <unk> call it a ' <unk> ' complex , and it is found , of course , in many religious figures as well . But Che does not ' sacrifice ' himself . He does what he does best , to the best of his not <unk> ability , and so provides an example . Success or failure in any particular instance become mere details.<br /><br />With the U.S. 's <unk> and illegal <unk> of Cuba ( all in the name of ' freedom ' ) , I am tempted to write that Che Parts 1 & 2 are too good to be wasted on the U.S. But that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so <unk> to avoid . One must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view Che without politics and the bias that inevitably <unk> . Whatever its faults , it <unk> Soderbergh from the populist nonsense of <unk> <unk> /><br />But if you have n't heard of Che Guevara or seen Part One , or if you ca n't get past the phrase ' murderous Marxist ' without <unk> at the mouth , I might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film . The same can be said for many who have , and can .
1.0 I saw Heartland when it was first released in 1980 and I have just seen it again . It improves with age . Heartland is not just for lovers of " indie " films . At a time when most American films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with CGI , pyrotechnics , and/or vulgarity , Heartland holds up as a slice of American history . It is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern , <unk> Americans are.<br /><br />Nothing in this film is overstated or stagey . No one <unk> any Hollywood movie speeches . The actors really inhabit their roles . This really feels like a " small " film but really it is bigger than most <unk> - dollar Hollywood <unk> /><br />The film is based on the lives of real people . In <unk> , Elinore Randall ( <unk> Ferrell , who has never done anything better than this ) , a widow with a 7-year - old daughter <unk> ( Megan <unk> ) , is living in Denver but wants more opportunities . She advertises for a position as housekeeper . The ad is answered by Clyde Stewart ( Rip Torn , one of our most under - appreciated actors ) , a Scots - born <unk> , himself a widower , with a <unk> outside of <unk> <unk> , Wyoming . Elinore accepts the position ( seven dollars a week ! ) and moves up to Wyoming with her daughter . She and her daughter move into Stewart 's tiny house on the property . It is rolling , <unk> <unk> , a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals . It 's guaranteed to make a person feel small . The three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul . What is worse , Stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent . " I ca n't talk to the man , " Elinore complains to Grandma <unk> . " You 'd better learn before winter , " replies Grandma . Grandma ( <unk> <unk> ) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than <unk> . She came out to Wyoming from Germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed . Grandma is their nearest neighbor ( and the local <unk> ) and still she lives ten miles away ! The other supporting character is Jack the hired hand ( Barry <unk> /><br <unk> 's routine ( and her employer 's ) is one of endless , <unk> labor , where there are no modern <unk> and where everything must be made , fixed or done by hand . This is the real meat of the film : Watching the ordinary life of these <unk> as they struggle against nature to <unk> a living from the land . But despite the constant <unk> and fatigue , Elinore is always looking for other opportunities . She learns that the tract <unk> to Stewart 's is <unk> . <unk> , she files a claim on the property ( twelve dollars , or almost two weeks ' pay ! ) , meaning that if she lives on it ( and she must actually live there ) and works it for ten years , she will get the deed to it . Naturally , Stewart learns what she has done . With merciless logic , he points out that with no money , no <unk> , no credit , and no assets , she has no chance of succeeding . He then offers a solution : He proposes marriage . The stunned Elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative , and <unk> /><br />We think that Stewart 's proposal is purely Machiavellian --- he wants the land and the free labor --- but we see that , in fact , he is genuinely fond of Elinore , and they grow together as a couple . She becomes pregnant ; she goes into labor in the middle of a <unk> <unk> ; Clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to Grandma 's and the ten miles back , only to announce that Grandma was n't there . This is more like real life than is pleasant , folks . Elinore has the baby all by herself , with no help whatsoever . Their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies . They lose half their <unk> to the vicious winter . They struggle on . The last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic : The birth of a calf . Clyde calls Elinore <unk> to help him deliver the calf . Instead of being head first , the calf is in a <unk> <unk> presentation . He and Elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal . There is no CGI , <unk> , trickery , <unk> or special effects : What you see is what happened , folks : A calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by <unk> . With that , the film does not so much end as simply stop , leaving the viewer unsatisfied , but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole , not just for its ending.<br /><br />This little gem rewards patience and <unk> . It will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten .
1.0 At the height of the ' Celebrity Big Brother ' racism row in 2007 ( involving <unk> Shetty and the late Jade <unk> ) , I condemned on an internet forum those ' <unk> ' fans who praised the show , after years of bashing ' racist ' ' 70 's sitcoms such as ' Curry & <unk> ' & ' Love <unk> <unk> ' . I thought they were being hypocritical , and said so . ' It <unk> n't Half Hot Mum ' was then thrown into the argument , with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blacked - up . Well , yes , but Michael Bates had lived in India as a boy , and spoke <unk> <unk> . The show 's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer ' Rangi Ram ' . The noted Indian character actor , <unk> <unk> , said in a 1995 documentary ' Perry & Croft : The <unk> ' that he was upset when he heard Bates had landed the role , but added : " No Indian actor could have played that role as well as Bates . " . <unk> /><br <unk> ' was Perry and Croft 's companion show to ' Dad 's Army ' ; also set in wartime , the <unk> English town of <unk> - On - Sea had been replaced by the hot , steamy jungles of India , in particularly a place called <unk> , where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops , among them <unk> <unk> ( George <unk> , his first sitcom role since ' Doctor In Charge ' ) , camp Gunner ' Gloria ' Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ) , diminutive Gunner ' <unk> ' <unk> , ' <unk> de - <unk> ' Gunner Graham ( John <unk> ) , and Gunner Parkins ( the late Christopher Mitchell ) . <unk> over this gang of misfits was the <unk> Sergeant - Major Williams ( the brilliant Windsor Davies ) , who regarded them all as ' <unk> ' . His frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to Parkins , whom he thought was his illegitimate son ! ) . Then there was ever - so English Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and dimwitted Captain <unk> ( Michael Knowles ) . Rangi was like a wise old sage , beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu <unk> . He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically British . His friends were the tea - making <unk> Wallah ( the late Dino <unk> , who went on to ' Mind Your Language ' ) and the rope pulling <unk> Wallah ( <unk> <unk> ) . So real Indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore . <unk> also provided what was described on the credits as ' vocal interruptions ' ( similar to the ' 40 's songs used as incidental music on ' Dad 's Army ' ) . Each edition closed with him warbling ' Land Of Hope & Glory ' only to be <unk> by a ' Shut Up ! ' from Williams . The excellent opening theme was penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek <unk> /><br />Though never quite <unk> ' Dad 's Army ' in the public 's affections , ' Mum ' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons . In 1975 , Davies and Estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ' . They then recorded an entire album of old <unk> , entitled ( what else ? ) ' Sing <unk> /><br />The show hit crisis point three years later when Bates died of cancer . Rather than <unk> the role of ' Rangi ' , the writers just let him be quietly forgotten . When George <unk> left , the character of ' Gloria ' took his place as ' <unk> ' , providing another source of comedy.<br /><br />The last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave India by boat for <unk> , the <unk> Wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ) .<br /><br <unk> have been few and far between ( mainly on U.K. Gold ) all because of its so - called ' dodgy ' reputation . This is strange . For one thing , the show was not specifically about racism . If a white man blacked - up is so wrong , why does David Lean 's 1984 film ' A <unk> to India ' still get shown on television ? ( it featured Alec Guinness as an Indian , and won two Oscars ! ) . It was derived from Jimmy Perry 's own experiences . Some characters were based on real people ( the Sergeant - Major really did refer to his men as ' <unk> ' ) . I take the view that if you are going to put history on television , get it right . <unk> the past , no matter how <unk> it might seem to modern audiences , is fundamentally dishonest . ' Mum ' was both funny and truthful , and viewers saw this . Thank heavens for <unk> 's I say . Time to stop this review . As Williams would say : " I 'll have no <unk> in this jungle ! "
1.0 Hong Kong directors crossing over to Hollywood to make movies is nothing new , with the temporary <unk> of the likes of Tsui Hark , John Woo , Ringo Lam in the 90s . From their collective output , only a few movies ( or may I say just one ? ) made an impact at the box office . The Andrew Lau and Alan <unk> partnership has been a tour de force in recent HK cinematic history , especially with their now famous <unk> Affairs trilogy which was remade into Martin Scorsese 's The Departed , so it 's no surprise when Hollywood comes knocking on the door.<br /><br />But without fellow collaborator <unk> , who usually has script / story duties , how did Lau fare with writers Hans Bauer and Craig Mitchell ? It 's like the X - Files without the X , in the way the story is crafted , the characters and the parallels drawn with the Chris Carter series . Richard Gere and Claire Danes pair up ala David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson , only that they do n't belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms , but are employees of <unk> <unk> , who 's chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their <unk> , are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time . Hence they are the <unk> tending to their flock , only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the <unk> for violence.<br /><br />The parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious , that it 's just a <unk> touch up on the outside . Like Fox Mulder , Gere 's Erroll Babbage is a strange , lonely man , consumed by his obsession in his quest to <unk> harass his flock to <unk> the line . <unk> by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child , just like how Mulder <unk> for his missing sister , Babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan . He has deep disgust for the people he 's <unk> , sick of their crimes and what they stand for , that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods , short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal , <unk> punishment . At the same time , he too has strong urges that he has to fight against , in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he <unk> . As part of routine , he also <unk> newspapers and tabloids for clues and leads toward his objective , that of seeking closure , salvation for himself , and possessing a strong belief that the truth is still out there , and he wants to <unk> /><br <unk> ' Allison <unk> on the other hand , is the <unk> brought in to replace Babbage . But in the meantime while learning the ropes on the job for the next 18 days , she is required to spy on him , and to report his shenanigans , pretty much like what Dana Scully was <unk> to do with Fox Mulder . As the <unk> of pre - <unk> and holding onto the notion that those <unk> back to society have been cured of their <unk> , she slowly starts to see what Babbage sees , and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just a desk and <unk> job if she truly wants to help people.<br /><br />And it is this discovery of the world of <unk> and <unk> sexual practices , that we open all our eyes to , much like how 8 mm starring Nicolas Cage brought snuff films into the spotlight . It 's a decent investigative drama with the usual red herrings , and my , are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your <unk> are correct , and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at alarming frequency , though I do n't credit this to a tight narrative , but more from the sprawling number of characters ( watch out for <unk> <unk> 's cameo ) and sub plots . The scene in the darkened <unk> / <unk> was akin to Se7en 's David Mills and William Somerset when they <unk> John Doe 's apartment and find plenty of <unk> inside , though here , given the subject nature , it was n't lingered upon much.<br /><br />Apparently , The Flock somehow decided that <unk> <unk> 's cinematography was good enough , despite its very strange style of having no style , utilizing almost every trick in the book to try and recreate feelings of watching another Se7en , only that this was deeply <unk> in <unk> of brown , rather than the doom and gloom of black . It does take a little while to get used to this , and I put this effect as one which actually distracts from what is happening in the story . Not a really good move though , with somewhat frequent repetition of scenes involving <unk> /><br />But The Flock still makes decent entertainment , though X - <unk> out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles , given so much similarities in character . Gere and Danes do put forth some chemistry as the old <unk> ( <unk> ) and his protégé , and while it 's not exactly great , Andrew Lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable .
1.0 " <unk> TO COME " Movie Review by <unk> < br /><br />Here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place . It is a film I 've only seen in truncated parts , but Art should be taken as a whole . I experienced this film as it was designed , in a darkened theatre , on a silver screen , with <unk> reels of film and an audience to share it with . That audience and myself were <unk> by this film ! One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered <unk> of war and <unk> by the positive , albeit corny , ending.<br /><br />The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits . The first thing we see is " H.G. Wells " in bold <unk> block copy much like the " Superman " of <unk> . It is not the film title , but the creator 's title , and then before any other humans , such as actors or production , are listed , the director William Cameron Menzies is up there ! Who ? You 've probably seen his work before , " Around the World in 80 Days , " " Pride of the Yankees , " and " Gone With the Wind . " He did not direct after this Sci - Fi epic opera he and Mr. Wells created , but his film imagery , sets , and design are very <unk> /><br />That imagery is very effecting . I recognized images from many other films , that have paid homage to this classic . The recent " <unk> 's Guide to the Galaxy " is obvious , along with Bugs Bunny , " <unk> , " " Monty Python and the Holy Grail , " " Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow , " " Night of the Living Dead " and more that I know of , but which titles escape me . This is real special effects here , scenes now done with CGI are done with actors , big sets , and detailed models . This film was made in 1936 , and it 's obvious it meant something to the other <unk> . Wells and Menzies also worked with Bliss , doing the music , and Korda , the producer , to create a masterpiece with message , warning , and <unk> /><br />The lines the Shakespearean actors Cedric Hardwicke , Ralph Richardson and Raymond Massey speak , sometimes sound preachy , but I also heard lines I still hear now . " These toys children have nowadays are nothing like I had when I was child , " " It 'll help develop their <unk> , " " What do we need books for , what do we need to read for ? " , " We do n't need cars , there 's nowhere to go , we have all we need right here , " " There will be no war . " But war there is ! The naive citizens of " Everytown " refuse to see the literal writing on the wall . The never - ending war explodes Christmas eve . The little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me . This is the world of 1936 that wore <unk> to Hitler 's <unk> . This war does not end . The poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.<br /><br />It is another dark age . No government , no services , and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about . <unk> , <unk> and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists . Loved ones are shot in the street , before they can carry the plague to another . <unk> there is a marvelous vignette about the Rolls Royce , that is a much needed respite mid - way . Into this lands a futuristic plane that <unk> the future.<br /><br />That future is the third act . The world has rebuilt itself with the help of that " <unk> animal , man . " <unk> fly in this film , before they were even invented . The <unk> 's Helper has other uses than the <unk> 's or Glenn Miller 's . Wide screen plasma screens <unk> the masses , and <unk> <unk> the people to tear it all down . " Beware the <unk> , you have been warned ! " , the city father warns the riotous populace . So be warned , this film might hit you like it hit me . There are some cute <unk> and <unk> , but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again , and I do want to see this artful film again . Others criticize Mr. Wells vision . It is very easy to work with <unk> hindsight regarding things , costumes and <unk> <unk> . I believe Mr. Wells ' " Things to Come " is not about things , but is actually about concepts , social trends , and philosophical ideals . Besides , we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come . This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction , but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera , sans singing , that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings .
1.0 whereas the hard - boiled detective stories of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken <unk> - indeed creating the <unk> modern American genre and style in the process - those of what might be called Golden Age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever . The problem with books like those of Agatha Christie , Dorothy L. <unk> or <unk> Van Dine ( on whose work this film is based ) , is that they are low on action or variety - whereas Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe <unk> the mean streets of LA , working class <unk> , bars , offices , wealthy <unk> , and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence , Golden Age fiction is generally fixed in location , the scene of the murder , usually a lavish country house , and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects . This is a very static procedure , plot reduced to <unk> /><br />This , of course , is as much ideological as anything else , the Golden Age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement ; the hard - boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre ( both of authority , and of a city ) , <unk> itself up into hostile , ever uncontrollable and lawless camps . Another major problem with Golden age fiction is character - because we can not know the answer to the crime until the end , we can not gain access to characters ' motivations or emotions , being defined solely by their potential need to murder . The detective , unlike the anxious , prejudice - ridden private eyes , are simply there to be brilliant , and maybe a little <unk> /><br />The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period <unk> of the Merchant Ivory / Jane Austen school , and end up looking silly . There have been successes , for example the radical <unk> of <unk> Queen and others by Claude Chabrol . In the English - speaking world , there have really only been two . The <unk> <unk> classic , ' Green For <unk> ' , works because it pushes the form almost into parody , while never <unk> the integrity or interest of the mystery.<br /><br />Before that came Michael Curtiz 's brilliant ' The Kennel Murder Case ' . The narrative is pure Golden Age . A repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him . He is duly murdered in a seemingly <unk> manner , indicating suicide , <unk> in a locked room . The <unk> policemen fall hopelessly for the bait . It is up to Philo Vance , gentleman and amateur detective , neither old nor fat , to read the clues more <unk> , open the case out of the confines of the room , and eventually solve the case , the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual <unk> /><br />What is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining , and full of comical bits of business . There is n't even really an attempt to ' <unk> ' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect , with no protest from Vance , but that 's about it.<br /><br />What marks ' Kennel ' as a classic is its <unk> . Curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur , because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development . But he was Hollywood 's greatest craftsman , and he is on sensational form here . if the Golden Age detective story is mere puzzle , Curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme , creating an abstract variation on his source , <unk> narrative , character and location to <unk> , a series of lines , from the beautiful art - deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and , as they <unk> <unk> at an angle , jolt the dead decor to life.<br /><br />This treatment is appropriate to a story that <unk> refuses realism , it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors , like the two central brothers , or the original crime itself , borrowed from an ' <unk> Mysteries ' book . This fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect Oriental <unk> ( shades of ' The <unk> ' ? ) , inscrutable Chinese servants , ex - cons turned <unk> , dog - loving <unk> , <unk> cops , is the perfect <unk> for Vance , a man who will drop a cruise to Europe on a fanciful <unk> , who knows the social world of these people , and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police , or would be if he was n't anything more than a thinking machine , William Powell , the greatest American comedian of the decade , bravely <unk> his idiosyncratic <unk> /><br />But if the treatment is <unk> , the climax is spectacularly brutal , involving vicious dogs and attempted murder . The police and the detective , supposed to be preventing crime , are guilty of <unk> one .
0.0 I remember watching the BSG pilot . I can describe that night exactly . I remember what chair I sat in . That show was magic . It came alive . I enjoyed the first two years of BSG . I enjoyed parts of the third year even , and I watched every episode of the fourth year , totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around . Well , it didn't.<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled . There was hope for something good here . Then I started watching the regular episodes , and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />It 's too obvious , too predictable . It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show , <unk> /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good . When he focused on BSG in an organized way , it was good . This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series . When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the <unk> , it all went to pot . It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />Maybe it will improve . Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes . But I am very , very nervous .
0.0 I was disgusted by this movie . No it was n't because of the graphic sex scenes , it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi . This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art . It shows one piece of art work that she did ( Judith <unk> <unk> ) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the <unk> /><br />I do n't know if you understood this from the movie , probably not , Tassi was not a noble character . He <unk> Artemisia . It was not love , it was rape . He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured . According to the rape <unk> he continued to claim that he never <unk> knew Artemisia ( aka had sex with ) while she states over and over again " It 's <unk> /><br />I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about . Do n't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie . I encourage you to do some research , Artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work.<br /><br />Don't see the movie , but find out the true story of Artemisia .
1.0 Like the characters in this show , I too was a teen during the 70s . The producers really nailed the whole <unk> , of being a suburban teenager in the 70s . The 70s fashions , cars , home furnishings , <unk> , and <unk> , are all very authentic in this show.<br /><br />The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast , who all mesh together very well on camera . I really like the unique , psychedelic - style film sequences . No other show does camera tricks like this . These cutting - edge film sequences , really help to convey the campy <unk> , that characterized the 70s era.<br /><br />Overall this is a very funny sitcom . The one thing that bothers me about this show , is it 's over - reliance on cruel humor , to generate laughs . In this way , I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children . While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right , it 's tacky that the creators of That 70s show , keep trying to imitate it . < br /><br />I do recommend That 70s Show , mainly due to it 's nostalgia factor . It could be an even better show though , if the writers relied more on witty dialog , rather than bawdy , tasteless jokes and pranks .
1.0 This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man . <unk> <unk> as Notre <unk> is a bit like an <unk> of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver , Inspector Clouseau ( in his <unk> ) and <unk> Gardiner in Being There ( also Peter Sellers ) . He is single yet does n't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact , he really makes no effort at <unk> /><br />He has a <unk> and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving <unk> - his friend Jose Garcia as <unk> is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended <unk> ( he 's 28 and admits he 's never had <unk> /><br />Very good outdoor shots of Paris and <unk> , where the two software people travel on business . They try various <unk> and places but all to no avail . My theory is that they 're trying the wrong places - they go to more - or - less ' youth ' <unk> ; they should try the type that has older people , more their own age.<br /><br <unk> increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de Niro effort , as in Taxi Driver , urging his friend / colleague to go and stab some bloke who 's pulled a nice - looking girl in the <unk> /><br />Worth watching .
1.0 This is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time . Darkness in <unk> was made in <unk> was a period of chaos , confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary <unk> of Estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty Soviet empire . It was in such a tense climate that a young country named Estonia was born . As newly established governments are known to encounter <unk> problems , Estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means . This is one of this film 's core themes . Darkness in <unk> appears as an Estonian film but it was made by a Finnish director <unk> <unk> . He has tried his best to <unk> as many possible doses of Estonian humor . This is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones . As ordinary people are involved in this film , we can say that this film <unk> good versus evil . This is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different <unk> . Darkness in <unk> shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be <unk> by corrupt people . A nice film to watch on a sunny day .
1.0 Sunny , a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area , is a bit dim , to put in mildly . She drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple . However , she saves the life of a prominent Arab , by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official . She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks . <unk> an opportunity , Presidential <unk> get her installed in the protocol department for the U.S. government . Even then , she messes things up at times , but she tries hard and learns a lot . She even grabs the romantic attention of a State department official . But , is there another sinister plot in the making , involving an Arab man who wishes to take another wife ? A blonde one ? LOL , LOL , LOL . This movie features Goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb " as a fox " , as they say . Sunny learns her way around the jungle of the U.S. government very , very well . She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings . Perhaps , the Arab community would be less than thrilled with this work , but for those who like to laugh , rent this today .
1.0 I do n't remember ever seeing this one before tonight , probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by . But it is a well crafted b Western , with an interestingly brooding storyline <unk> by acting <unk> from the good to <unk> /><br />Robert Mitchum <unk> into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter , and stays for a time as town - tamer . As usual the good business folk have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring . It still applies : relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the <unk> but pretend to <unk> the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people . What 's fascinating about this film is Mitchum 's <unk> intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies , and the townsfolk 's acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones . <unk> bit : the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the Red Dog saloon . The firing of the main saloon <unk> on nasty , but it was an effective way to combat the spread of <unk> /><br />Overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little <unk> - not so good for Do - <unk> who would probably prefer a lifetime of <unk> with Evil rather than end it .
1.0 this is an entertaining movie . actually might make you uncomfortable since it is n't some undead psychopath or sociopath , its your everyday doctor . how scary is that . got some good actors and actresses in this movie , though some where <unk> like <unk> <unk> as Sarah . Ken Foree who you might recognize from rob zombie 's <unk> rejects and <unk> ) co - stars as our detective on <unk> Dr. Alan <unk> <unk> . Short little summary is this : Dr. Alan Feinstone , a guy who has a sexy wife , nice house , and is a great dentist everyone loves . Until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner . Then he starts having hallucinations that his patients ' teeth are all <unk> and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller . But before that , nice guy .
1.0 The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy ( duh ) , is lacking a bit in the story department , but covers it with extensive action scenes ! <unk> in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.<br /><br />The director and star ( Damon ) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part , because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story - wise . How they got around that ? The action scenes , for once , but they did another thing too , which I ca n't reveal , because that would be a spoiler . But if you watch the movie , than you 'll notice it ! <unk> enough I read , that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you <unk>
1.0 As with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up . Even the Grim Ripper made us smile . Those two alien things made me laugh , Bill and Ted were the stupidest yet the <unk> in the entire movie . This is a lot better than the first one . And yet for some reason I feel that it misses something . Something big . Something important . Made a better house and girlfriends . No , I 'd say better villains . Use clones instead of robots . I gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic <unk> /><br />The Grim Ripper , do n't be scared he 's not the <unk> kind , is funny . When he fell from the sky I split a gut . <unk> , I 'm not sure about those aliens . What where they ? Scientists ? No way .
0.0 Essentially a story of man versus nature , this film has beautiful cinematography , the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going . <unk> Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation 's <unk> , played by Dana Andrews . The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch 's late father whose ghost casts a <unk> over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch . The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right - of - way . The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture . Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch .
0.0 <unk> ! ! ! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it . I was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end . Other than that I was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time . Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his Dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there 's a full moon . He kills his father and friends . About 30 years past but he does n't age a bit and <unk> in a high school . There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her . This movie sucked and I do n't recommend it to anyone . Read War and Peace instead . Only Ms. Hartman did a great job . Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one ! !

1.0 Generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending ; the acting was spectacular and the characters did n't stray from their persons . I especially liked the plot , although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie . However , I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer ( extended <unk> to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit ; as if the writer was trying to take <unk> off the lines before the rain fell . For <unk> What happened to Tristan 's brother , Hayden ? For all we know he died in the hospital . Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing ? ! Who knows ! Maybe there will be a sequel ? Maybe ? If there is .. I ca nt wait to see it .
1.0 ( <unk> /><br />I was blown away by this movie . I 've been renting on <unk> for a bit , and decided to check this movie out . <unk> of boxing movies seem to <unk> the blood . In this movie , it shows it at the <unk> level . Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades . The movie points out the problems some families face with <unk> /><br />I was a bit concerned with the ending . But the ending was n't a disappointment either.<br /><br />I think it was pretty clear by the title that she 'd win . What was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end.<br /><br />Loved the score for some of the scenes . Highly recommended.<br /><br <unk> /><br <unk> : <unk> /><br <unk> : <unk> /><br <unk> : 10/10
0.0 Cynthia <unk> <unk> <unk> , made this film enjoyable to watch and of course , e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body . China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad , who is the local sheriff . Her dad is getting older and the town has changed , gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell . Well , you almost can guess what happens , and you are right , China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life . Bad acting through out the picture , but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion .
1.0 Red Eye , a movie that i d had wanted to see for awhile ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack <unk> ( jack the <unk> ) a <unk> pose to <unk> , and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly <unk> man and his family.<br /><br />An everyday woman " Lisa " ( I think ) is a normal woman , goes to work , home ... worries ... hates to <unk> /><br />The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times.<br /><br />a flight where she meets Jack ... an ordinary seeming guy , until he <unk> reveals his profession and plans , which coincidentally include her in them , she is the key to the <unk> 's ( sp ? ) death.<br /><br />She succeeds in saving them ... but nearly the cost of her life is taken , Jack is beaten ... the <unk> are saved ... oh what a story * laughs * just kidding , the movie is really good actually , the best of last year ... there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a GREAT importance to the movie later ... ( the Frankenstein pen ) I watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks ... <br /><br />a must see for thriller fans no sexual , but there is a slight hint ( the bathroom scene ) ( jack ) " Thanks for the <unk> " and the ( female attendant ) " <unk> ... its gon na be ONE of those <unk> " ( second female attendant ) " Hey ! this is n't a motel " you get the idea ...
1.0 IF ANYONE IS <unk> IN <unk> A <unk> OF THIS FILM PLEASE READ THE <unk> OF THIS <unk> : First <unk> by CBS on November 30 , 2003 , the made - for - TV Finding John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year 's A Town Without Christmas , with Peter Falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel Max . Valerie <unk> plays Kathleen <unk> , a divorced small - town nurse whose depression ... over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $ 100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by <unk> Noah <unk> ( David Cubitt ) . The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noah 's firefighter brother Hank ( William Russ ) , who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and has n't been seen since . Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare , but this proves impossible when Noah 's newspaper posts a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank , known only to the public as " John Christmas . " And there 's something , very , very curious about that photo : It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in <unk> without an <unk> . That elusive " Santa " is of course the angelic Max , who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of <unk> to solve problems , dispense advice , tie up loose plot strands -- and even share a musical duet with Kathleen 's talented daughter <unk> ( Jennifer <unk> /><br <unk> IN <unk> A <unk> : WRITE TO ME HERE : <unk>
1.0 Sure , Titanic was a good movie , the first time you see it , but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will <unk> change . The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love - story and think : ooh , how romantic . The second time ( and I am not the only one to think this ) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking , When is this <unk> ship going to sink ? ? ? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times . The acting in this film is not bad , but <unk> not great either . Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film , I mean who does he think he is , Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington ? He does 1 half - good movie and wo n't do a film for less than $ 20 million . And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it . But enough about , in my eyes , the worst character of the film . Kate Winslet 's performance on the other hand was wonderful . I also <unk> that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together . There is one lesson to be learned about this movie : there are too many love - stories as it is , filmmakers should n't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie ! ! ! Out of a possible 100 % I give this film a mere 71 % .
1.0 Here is a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween . I know it <unk> have much creepiness , but has the ' trick ' as in " Trick or Treat , " as Jerry did to Tom with the window blind and the vacuum - cleaner with a <unk> - shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost ; but still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons . In this short , Tom was listening to the " <unk> Hour , " a ghost - story program on the radio , and being frightened by the horror story being told . Halfway into the story , the dramatics ( hair standing on end , heart leaping into throat , icy chills on spine ) begin happening to Tom . . . literally . And Jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself , thought he <unk> Tom fears by scaring him.<br /><br />I love the ending , it was a little funny . And you know , This short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes ; the others being The <unk> Mouse , A Mouse in the House and <unk> - Witty Kitty . And also This short is the first of twenty - five cartoons where Tom speaks . The others are The <unk> Mouse , The <unk> Cat , The Million Dollar Cat , The <unk> , Mouse Trouble , The Mouse Comes to Dinner , Quiet Please ! , Trap Happy , Solid <unk> , Mouse <unk> , Texas Tom , <unk> Mouse , and The Cat Above and the Mouse Below directed by Chuck Jones .
0.0 The problem with family dramas is that , outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime , most people do n't want to watch them . And the ones that do get watched tend to be <unk> and about current or topical problems or issues in the news ( or recent news ) . Movies that explain or explore the human condition are n't popular . Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohan 's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for <unk> /><br />The specific problems I had with this movie is the <unk> of some of the characterizations . It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohan 's character 's acting - out ( wrecking the car , drug use , etc . ) on what her step - father did to her . While not improbable , it 's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow . Additionally , other aspects , such as her giving the young <unk> boy , oral sex , or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet , who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother , etc . , all these elements just did not really help this movie along . It placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their " special dramatic episodes " then it did for a fully realized , well - written feature film.<br /><br />When you watch the DVD and listen to the commentary , particularly for the various alternate endings , you can really see all of this is sharp focus .
1.0 Strangely , this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced . <unk> by hindsight , Crowe 's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar 's original . The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first , but there 's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly . Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES , but you know almost everything about the lead in <unk> <unk> . That 's what i mean by more " fleshed out . "
1.0 A most awaited film of the year 2002 . After three and half years of <unk> , <unk> has acted in this movie . The hype for this film was <unk> high .. <br /><br />This is not a typical <unk> film , in this film he gives some spiritual messages also . But it also includes typical <unk> actions , style , songs etc . Its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also.<br /><br />I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay . Its a must watch movie . Do nt miss it !
1.0 Do n't say I did n't warn you , but your gon na laugh . Probably enough to hurt your stomach . Sure it 's got some blood splattering , all in good fun though . So , it 's got no budget , who needs a budget when you got a script like this . < br /><br />Take the time and check this out . Well worth a two hour viewing . If everyone could laugh as much as I did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live.<br /><br / >
1.0 I was n't sure what to expect but am I glad I went to see this . A smart , slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . I was n't quite sure how a director can create " nothing " , but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at <unk> to create another low budget set that looks real ( as real as nothing can be ) . Well worth your time and money , if you have the opportunity to see this , please go . You 'll be glad you did .
1.0 An interesting TV movie based on true fact , betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters , that of a prisoner . Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother , who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother 's death penalty . But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias <unk> , the problem starts . It has nothing to do with <unk> ' acting ability . He just looks like the version of a prisoner of <unk> roots according to " <unk> " magazine , with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars . This realization came to me after meeting again an old friend , whom I had not seen for almost 15 years , which he spent in several <unk> <unk> . The young man I used to know is gone , not only because he is older , but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the <unk> system . There are <unk> and there are <unk> , one must say , but this one prisoner in " Shot In the Heart " is definitely out of this world .
0.0 Well it 's not often that we in the UK have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community , the last example that I can remember was the underrated Babylon way back in 1980 . So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy , a film that has been touted as the British version of La <unk> ! Well La <unk> it is not ! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late , but my concern is that this film predictably ends <unk> /><br />The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London , but I 'm concerned that film makers now use type - casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging . Saul <unk> had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all , but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in London the only future is violence & tragedy
1.0 As is nearly always the case , when Britain comes up with an entertaining and/or successful sit - com or <unk> show , the Yanks will come along and <unk> the format and produce their own , grossly inferior , version . Man About The House is , of course , no exception to that rule . The Yanks ' version ( Three 's Company ) was unwatchable , <unk> pap that seem to run forever . A prime example of quantity over ( non - existent ) quality . The original , on the other hand , is a fondly - remembered gem that had the savvy ( like Fawlty Towers ) to pull the plug at precisely the right time ( unlike the <unk> episodes of ' hilarity ' that Three 's Company came up with ) . Jo was cute , there was brilliant chemistry between the <unk> , Richard O'Sullivan made it all look so easy , the scripts , whilst not exactly Oscar Wilde - standard , were consistently funny and Chrissy was THE most drop - dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since The Dead Sea was merely feeling <unk> . ' <unk> said .
1.0 This movie <unk> me cry at the end ! I watch at least 3 - 4 movies a week . I seen loads of great movies , even more crap - ones . But when ending scene - <unk> at it 's core - came I <unk> ! And if you did n't - you have serious problems ! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original . But it 's real - because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist . <unk> is n't my sort of music but I really admire all that they went through in early 70 's ... At some point this directed me toward Velvet <unk> ! <unk> never really work very good . But this movie really <unk> us believe it all ... Because they do n't try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts , present musicians that are superheroes , groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb , they do n't glorify drugs and alcohol , they promote <unk> and redemption that comes even 20 years late ... Once again great movie . Since " Leaving Las Vegas " I was never so moved by a movie .
1.0 This movie is obviously low - budget & filmed in British Columbia , Canada . The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie <unk> in California & late <unk> well conceived . I believe this is the best & most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of <unk> & the Bay area from 1968 - 19 ? ( he was never <unk> James <unk> . Dave <unk> ) & George <unk> - at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen , since cleared by DNA & <unk> a game of cat & mouse re - visiting crime scenes together , each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation . <unk> dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing <unk> did it , still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way . <unk> totally oblivious & self <unk> all serial killers ) to the carnage left in his wake . The only disappointment was <unk> the top " ending otherwise pretty accurate . If you tire of the typical Hollywood fluff or have an interest in the Zodiac case , check it out .
1.0 After <unk> <unk> first work " I m <unk> " , which was fairly good , he created a really gorgeous italian family epic . Its a german movie , which is unfortunately a bad <unk> , cause we <unk> produce more than moderate movies ;) . But this movie makes some very good <unk> of the time then . " <unk> " is about a Italian immigrant who arrives in the " <unk> " region of Germany during the 60s . The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region . The characters are excellent drawn . Especially Gigi , the main actor . You live every second , every feeling he does . His brother , played by <unk> <unk> , is nt that good . Well , you just do nt believe him the role . But the character is <unk> and fits perfectly into this script . I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of " The Godfather " . Many people will probably hate this movie , say its boring . Not much tension ? - yes , but an outrageous movie . 9 out of 10 .
1.0 This was the Modesty that we did n't know ! It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the <unk> to sell to newspapers ! Lee and Janet <unk> were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job - tell a prequel story of Modesty that the fans never saw before . In their audio - commentary , they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run <unk> . The " purists " should also note that we really do n't know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was " <unk> for time . " I did n't rent or borrow the DVD like other " reviewers " did , I bought it ! And I do n't want a refund ! I watched it three times and I did n't sleep through it ! Great dialog and well - drawn characters that I cared about ( even bad guy Miklos ) just like in the novels and comic strips ! I too ca n't wait for the next Modesty ( and Willie ) film , especially if this " prequel " is a sign of what 's to come !
1.0 I would n't be surprised if Soderbergh was <unk> to avoid making <unk> revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was . <unk> reciting a few statistics is n't going to make it with the younger crowd . Still , part one , which is almost entirely shot in the jungle , does capture the feel of that place , especially when <unk> the <unk> areas of Cuba . I liked Del Toro 's interpretation of Che Guevara 's personality . And the actor who plays Castro , Bichir , also did a great job , against all odds . It 's clear Soderbergh does n't look down on these people , but it 's also clear he 's not going to plea their case to ' <unk> ' far removed from the recent past . Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I 've read . To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted . But on other aspects he is right on , especially as to the looting by the <unk> as the island went other rebel control . The country 's treasury was left empty .
1.0 This is one military drama I like a lot ! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett . This Marine is no - nonsense , in your face , and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done . There you have Billy <unk> Phantom " and others ) who plays Richard Miller , a former SWAT form D.C. , works for the government and takes orders only from them . Who needs a bureaucrat ? I do n't ! When these two are paired , sparks should be flying . And how . However , Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works . When the other sniper hits , it 's wits vs. wits , cat vs. mouse , gunman vs. gunman . And when the seasoned sniper is caught , it 's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him . Who needs politics when you a pro like Beckett , he took orders from no one but himself , plays by the rules and not the book , and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics . The movie was a direct hit . Watch it . Rating 4 out of 5 stars .
1.0 I actually did n't start watching the show until it came on FX . I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show 's reruns were <unk> so i decided to watch it . I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v . I loved the show so <unk> a show for everyone to enjoy . I remember Full House and Family <unk> and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough . They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid , but not That 70s Show . That 70s Show was hilarious , smart and so real . I think it was the best show ever made and I 'm very sorry that it ended . Although I love this show , I do think it should have ended on the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave . The last season was just not right , Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves . I still love this show and I hope TV starts making more shows like this one .
1.0 This film has a lot of strong points . It has one of the best horror casts outside of the Lugosi - Karloff - Chaney circle : Lionel Atwill , Fay Wray , and Dwight Frye , plus leading man Melvyn Douglas . It 's got all the right ingredients : bats , a castle with lots of stone <unk> , a mad scientist , townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires , an " <unk> character , a beautiful girl , even a goofy - haired <unk> . The soft - focus camera work is moody and imaginative . There 's even some good comic relief nicely <unk> throughout the script.<br /><br />But it 's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in " <unk> " ( " little castle " ) . The plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist ( nicely played by Atwill ) who values his work more highly than human lives.<br /><br />It 's not top - tier material , because of a ho - hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for Dwight Frye . But it 's worth a look if you like early b / w horror pictures .
1.0 As a another reviewer states Hanna 's War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person , Hanna " <unk> " <unk> , who would become the Jewish Joan Of <unk> . Unfortunately I <unk> in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter . In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a <unk> she faces . <unk> Detmers performance is brave , poignant , heartfelt or understood , and totally believable . In other words for me " In the zone . " from the opening credits . If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hanna 's War with <unk> Detmers a try . My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna 's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film . In that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress ' but not an All About Eve situation .
1.0 As Most Off You Might off Seen Star Wars : Return Off The Jedi You May Knows Its A Good Movie But As You Might Have Seen On Video They <unk> have a party At The end And They Just Probably End The Movie with the party with no a spirits or anything But on the original one ( Live TV ) When they are <unk> But before i say more when Ben <unk> - wan dies in the Imperial Ship Or Death Star They Saw him <unk> And Yoda <unk> From Either Old Age Or Internal <unk> But because Luke killed Darth Vader ( Real Name : Anakin Skywalker ) When They All Are <unk> At The end when Luke Or Someone <unk> the Spirits Off Ben And Yoda <unk> Starring At Him And <unk> While Another Spirit <unk> Is its Darth Vader but not as A Sith As The Old Usual <unk> off Him And <unk> <unk> with Ben And Yoda I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off <unk> And Mace <unk> And Other <unk> that got killed with <unk> Under There Arms in the back ground
1.0 Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be " Who ? " or perhaps " Why ? " Well , believe it or not , Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film , which is about a poor , desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for " <unk> " to the United States . It 's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well - meaning <unk> will go just for a few bucks . The movie takes place in British - dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland , all Mr. McLaglen 's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk . The movie makes one wonder whether political <unk> is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point , many others not only do not care , they do n't even know what the fuss is all about . The morale of this movie is : look out for the friend , he may sell you out for a dime .
0.0 Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event , even though he did save many other captive children . The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen <unk> the hallways , <unk> and even class rooms . In other words , the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal . Dolph <unk> <unk> ) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field . However , the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher . It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB . Try to enjoy it , if you decided to View IT !
1.0 Putting the UFO " thing " aside . This was the best documentary I 've seen . <unk> reporting by Neil and Buzz ... a must see . The interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped <unk> in 1969 and only released in 2006 . No documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes ... The <unk> will blow you away , and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest hero 's of our time . Ever see a man save his own life ? Bet not . Neil saves his life when only <unk> - seconds separated him from death . Amazing to watch . It is a travesty people have not known all the details <unk> with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death , from a failing computer ... 10 stars !
1.0 As I am no fan of almost any <unk> Living " John Waters films , I warmed to " Pecker " . After he emerged from the underground , Waters produced trash - lite versions of his earlier works ( " Cry Baby " , " <unk> " , <unk> " ) that to die - hard fans looked and <unk> like watered down <unk> . " Pecker " , which does n't attempt to <unk> early successes , is a slight , quiet , humble commentary on the <unk> of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world . Waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold ( at ridiculous prices ) some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you could n't imagine anyone being able to give away if it was n't <unk> with the Waters " name " . Edward Furlong is fine as " Pecker " and Waters ' non - histrionic style is at ease with the subject .
1.0 on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up . i do n't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that have n't watched it yet but i will say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role such as past Priyadarshan movies , for example , Hera Pheri and Hungama . Paresh Rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him , John Abraham does equally well , Akshay Kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from Waqt and almost all his movies after <unk> . Even though all three <unk> in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly <unk> who is very good looking and hot . i would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must watch .
1.0 Finally ! An Iranian film that is not made by <unk> , <unk> or the <unk> . This is a non - documentary , an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the ' system ' in its ass . It 's all about football and its funny , its really funny . The director says " The places are real , the event is real , and so are the characters and the extras . This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors , as their presence would have introduced a notion of <unk> . " The non - actors will have you rooting for them <unk> unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind . <unk> scripted , the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness . It has won the Jury Grand Prize , Berlin , 2006 . Dear reader , it 's near - perfect . WHERE , where can I get hold of it ?
0.0 Williamson 's accent is tough to wade through . He speaks incredibly quickly , like he is in a rush to get through the lines . During the <unk> he acts as if he is talking to someone , when he is supposed to be talking to himself . All that and his bald spot just annoyed me . He was just too old for this role . In reading other accounts of Williamson , maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life - <unk> - art or forced method acting . When the actors declare Hamlet mad you believe it ! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could <unk> the role of Ophelia and still get a pass . The set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky .
1.0 This movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is <unk> than the original . Its comedy at its best . This movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second . At more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke.<br /><br />Its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a <unk> /><br <unk> <unk> 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production TV series such as survivor ( <unk> : Robinson in Swedish ) This is a Swedish movie for the Swedish audience . Thus do n't see it if you are n't familiar with Sweden and its language . Otherwise : Have fun ! <unk>
1.0 JUST <unk> is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative ( though exceedingly predictable ) writing . Sean Connery is an anti - death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man ( Blair Underwood ) from the ultimate penalty . To set things right , Connery ventures to the scene of the crime , where he must contend not only with the passage of time , but a meddling sheriff ( Laurence <unk> ) . <unk> and turns and role <unk> abound -- some surprising , some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery . The climactic ending is a bit ludicrous , but JUST <unk> is worth a look on a slow night .
1.0 I ca n't understand why many IMDb users do n't like this movie . Why they think it 's sooooo bad etc . It 's not worse than anything else out there . Personally I think " Soldier " is a great movie , far better than most other films in the same genre.<br /><br <unk> why I liked " Soldier " : Kurt Russel , Connie Nielsen , Jason Scott Lee , the script ( David Webb Peoples ) , great visual effects , and the directing ( Paul <unk> /><br />I even think that this is the best work I 've seen from director Paul Anderson , who has previously directed the entertaining " Mortal <unk> " and the not so entertaining " Event Horizon " .
1.0 The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too . It was extremely funny . <unk> Jolie was wonderful as Juliet . The parents are hilarious . They are <unk> as well as enemies . The kids play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play . They fall in love and their parents try to keep them <unk> <unk> . I think ) They sneak off after a party and do it . Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie . If you do n't like stereotypes and the <unk> of classic literature do n't watch . If you do n't mind those you will have a blast watching this one .
1.0 Along with " Brothers & Sisters " , " Six <unk> " was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006 . < br /><br />Great cast all around , but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott ( the come - back <unk> ) and Hope Davis ( recent widow of journalist killed in <unk> /><br />Aside from the acting , the writing was fresh and the acting superb . The show was also shot in NYC , the real city , not the Warner Bros. or some other studio 's <unk> , adding a secondary layer or realism . < br /><br />I guess people are more interested in the latest " Survivor " and other reality garbage . Too bad it did n't last .
1.0 Some people have stated that as of the 11th season , South Park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs ; but this could not be further from the truth.<br /><br />While this episode does spoof the Living Dead series , there is more . It is a satire of how people treat the homeless . Characters say things like " They 're pretending to be just like us " or " They want to be human . " This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck.<br /><br />So yes , it is still a satire , and also a wonderful spoof . What more could you want ?
1.0 Really , I liked it . The premise was good , the story fit where both respective series left off , and here 's my favorite part . Mary and Valerie are n't bitter ! They are n't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it , or do possible <unk> ( A prime example is Susan Dey , " The <unk> Family " ) . In fact , Valerie was saying that she 'd be thrilled to do another movie , and then Mary said the same thing later , so I would be on the look for another ... but if that does n't quite work out , then they can re - run this one .
0.0 Sorry to go against the flow but I thought this film was unrealistic , boring and way too long . I got tired of watching Gena Rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing . Maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value I wish I would have skipped it .
1.0 A long time ago , I watched this movie from the middle on cable . I then had a crush on Mary <unk> . I saw her again in Eating Raoul . I was convinced that she 's the hottest woman on screen.<br /><br />I maybe biased about this movie . 9 out of 10.<br /><br />This 's the only movie I own on original tape .
1.0 there is a story , but more essentially , the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes.<br /><br />it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good . representing along an <unk> unexplored in previous cinema , this film should be taught in every high school.<br /><br <unk> *
1.0 I like this movie much , it 's special type of humor by <unk> and <unk> ... I think it 's better then <unk> ( <unk> ) .. Maybe it 's difficult to understand when you are not Czech . If you are not watching that movie , just enjoy it , do n't mind about anything else .. just relax ! !
0.0 Devil Dog sets your heart racing . It 's brilliantly paced , the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being . You 'll never look at your dog the same way again . In fact you 'll start thinking of having it put down - BY A <unk> ! <unk> !
1.0 " Footlight Parade " is fascinating on so many levels . There is no way the supposedly staged " theater prologues " could have been produced in any theater on earth , of course . Think of the huge <unk> and three - story tall <unk> for " By A Waterfall , " for instance . ( Berkeley directed John Garfield in " They Made Me a Criminal " six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing " By a Waterfall " as they took their showers . ) < br /><br <unk> Lil " is the best production number in the picture . It 's a catalog of ' 30s Warner Bros. sensibilities . Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes . You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were <unk> on a train or maids in a big house . Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a " card section " presentation of Roosevelt 's image . There 's also the <unk> eagle -- the logo of the controversial National <unk> <unk> of the New Deal . <unk> was the new president and hopes were so high that he 'd pull the nation out of the Depression . You 'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM , of course . Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the <unk> dictated by the <unk> administration . < br /><br <unk> little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker , " Lil . " She hardly even watches her feet as she dances , which was one of her signature flaws . < br /><br />The Pre - Code stuff is fun . The " By a Waterfall " number is wonderful in that regard . The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on . The spread - eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years . In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .
0.0 Another variation and <unk> on the famous and beloved children tale , La <unk> ( 1975 ) aka The Beast tries to imagine ( in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way ) , what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast ? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie . I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration , longing , fulfillment , or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion . I would not even call it a horror - erotic movie . It 's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it 's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.<br /><br />The long ( way too long ) scene between an <unk> young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I 've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive ... well anatomy , is set to the <unk> music of <unk> and is hysterical . My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter . The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster . The question is - who is the target audience for the film ? For an erotic picture , it is too <unk> ; for an art movie - it 's got too many jaw - dropping scenes of sheer madness and I 'd say an abrupt ending . IMO , the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama . As a parody of art house / horror / erotica , it is funny and certainly original . Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning . This story of the curious <unk> and the lustful <unk> certainly is not recommended for co - viewing with the children . The opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used On Discovery channel for the program like " In the world of animals - mating habits and rituals of horses " .
1.0 Larry Fessenden has been <unk> by most of the comments on this forum . Well , the worst mistake , evidently , is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted . Obviously , this is not a true horror movie , at least , not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying . < br /><br <unk> " is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles . Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they ca n't comprehend . It is obvious that Kim , the mother , is a psychologist , but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son . This is also a story of alienation . It 's clear that the father , George , is a distant figure , perhaps a <unk> , who seems to be living in a different world.<br /><br <unk> ' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country . That part of New York state , with its winter landscape , barren trees , play havoc on the little boy 's imagination . It does n't help that he encounters a strange figure in town , it creates even more doubts in his young mind . Ultimately , Miles ' world comes crashing down on him and he ca n't do anything , even evoking the Wendigo <unk> /><br />The film is well paced and acted . Patricia Clarkson is excellent , no matter where movie she is in . Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he does n't understand . Erik Per Sullivan , as Miles , conveys the inner turmoil within him . I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what 's going on around him . Finally , John <unk> is perfect as the menacing Otis , a man who <unk> the world for the way he has turned out.<br /><br />Instead of putting this movie down , future viewers should approach it with a open mind .
1.0 Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s , this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence , materialism and keeping up with the <unk> , fear of others , slavery , golf , and the disposing of the dead . Yes , it all sounds a bit heavy , but trust me on this , it 's nearly as light as a <unk> /><br <unk> are featured prominently among the characters . <unk> questions arise , such as : who will become a zombie ( 90 % of the Willard folks choose this final path , while only 10 % prefer a traditional funeral ) ? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots ( they 've become a mark of social status ) ? And , what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead ? < br /><br />Somehow , director Andrew Currie , who also co - wrote the lively screenplay ( with Robert <unk> and Dennis Heaton ) , keeps this improbable material <unk> along for an hour and a half without once <unk> for want of a good laugh . A super cast helps : Carrie - Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Dylan Baker , Henry <unk> , Tim Blake Nelson , Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals , aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy , the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the <unk> . ( Having seen her only in " Memento " and " The Matrix , " I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such fine comedienne chops . ) < br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s , to a tee . Maybe this one is n't for everybody . It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual <unk> Award . But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie - making . For me anyway , " Fido " is a hoot ! My grades : 8.5/10 ( A- ) ( Seen on <unk> )
1.0 This is a <unk> colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford . ... and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s , an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties ' exuberance and <unk> put to song and dance . THE SHOW OF <unk> is pretty gigantic . <unk> act after soliloquy after tap dance after <unk> after comedian after fan - dance after <unk> lunacy after <unk> Tin Tin who introduces ' an oriental number ' ... ( ! ) ... and on and on it <unk> , grinning and <unk> away in fabulous <unk> quality <unk> sound . It is far too long , but among it 's delirious delights are the awesome " Singin in the <unk> " number created on a scale of which The <unk> <unk> would be proud ... Beatrice Lillie <unk> by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty <unk> , Nick Lucas , and the never - ending grand finale in two color color ... which is all set to the song LADY <unk> . . So keen are the <unk> chorus line and leaping teenagers to en - <unk> - <unk> us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort . Row after row of " Doll " characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor . I kid you not , there are even girls strapped to the crystal <unk> , mummified with shiny <unk> and chained up with pearl ropes , unable to move ( for days , I imagine , during production ) whilst this <unk> of toy - box athleticism twitch and <unk> below to the <unk> orchestra . Of course I loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to <unk> and <unk> them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions . And so should you ... and <unk> that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill . It is all so demented .
1.0 This film appears to draw a borderline - on one side , those who love it , on the other , those who find it unbearable.<br /><br />To begin with , there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not " getting " . Of course jet Li 's Mask looks like Bruce Lee 's <unk> - he 's supposed to , it 's a joke . The guy who has a time - bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous ? of course , it 's a joke ! Some readers will probably ask , if this film is supposed to be so funny , why all the excessive and gory violence ? well , for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different , from culture to culture ; and while Hong Kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme , it 's certainly only slightly more than average for a HK action film.<br /><br />Also , Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre 's conventions and pushes them to extremes , simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic . After decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds , many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch <unk> blood all over the place . But the fact is , when you 're shot with rapid metal <unk> , it 's almost certain that blood will <unk> , especially from an <unk> /><br />This film is a Chinese comic book movie . It is true that the Spiderman films never get this gory - but if they were faithful to reality , they would be ! Well , despite its comic - book origins , this film is faithful to reality.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the flashy , over - stylized filming and editing . If the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to Hollywood - style nostalgia ( as , e.g. , The <unk> , or the recent Sky captain film ) , I doubt anyone would have found it <unk> /><br />But as it stands , I still had a <unk> fun watching this movie .
1.0 It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip " Basic Instinct 2 , " to the point that a significant part of the audience ( including critics ) found it terrible even before it was released . It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone <unk> all of <unk> now fourteen years older , <unk> most of <unk> looks wonderful . First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself . In my opinion , this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film , but is not as bad as most comments pretend . Michael Caton - Jones is not Paul Verhoeven , neither Henry Bean and <unk> <unk> are Joe <unk> . " Basic Instinct 2 " is just an entertaining , average thriller , and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score , keeps little resemblance to its predecessor . Even Stone gives her character a different dimension , creating a lustful , devilish Catherine <unk> , who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter . She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her <unk> . Unfortunately , she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick . She became too successful , too much of a main icon , and like all those actors who have reached that level , her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood <unk> /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding , giving performances that are far better than the material deserves . David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas : his acting is flawless , giving a dense , complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character . Since he has more screen time and is the <unk> of the movie , he can keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am not recommending " Basic Instinct 2 " as a great movie ; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are <unk> the opinion of most spectators .
1.0 Ah , the best and funniest movie about female football fans , only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in North London ( <unk> ) . By the way , I just watched this on Film 4 [ 2008 - 12 - 21 ] and am <unk> my inability to set the <unk> /><br />This is easily my second favourite football movie after " Mike Bassett : England Manager " , but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of movie - making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made ( just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the Sun is setting : fast reactions all round ) . < br /><br />It is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud , but when the rural soldier <unk> one of the girls into the <unk> while forcing her to wear an <unk> mask made from a poster of Ali <unk> , I could n't stop waking the others in the house with my <unk> , especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather 's calls for assistance ... < br /><br />Speaking of the toilets , I just wish I could speak <unk> so that I could work out the writing on the toilet walls ( yes , there were a few <unk> in Roman script , but they mostly referred to <unk> American rock <unk> /><br />Also , on the rural - and - <unk> theme , do n't you reckon that <unk> <unk> sounds like a <unk> when he talks <unk> ? Listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go " <unk> /><br />I'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of Iran , and I 'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting ; my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing : top notch stuff.<br /><br />Here 's a list of my top favourite football movies : 1 . Mike Bassett , England Manager 2 . Offside 3 . Those Glory Glory Days 4 . A Shot at Glory 5 . The <unk> Stadium Mystery
1.0 Are you a <unk> ? ... ask John to Nadia , and she , sure of responding well , responds him : yes . In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who do n't know each other , and at the same time , the questions and doubts in " Birthday Girl " . A film that i heard a lot of times , but i do n't dare to see ... until two hours of write this.<br /><br <unk> Girl " is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count , at the same time , that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress ( Besides she is pretty and intelligent ) that i have ever seen . " Birthday Girl " is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet . The woman that he finds comes from Russia . She seems to be that delicate woman , normal , not more . One day , in her birthday comes suddenly , his cousin and his friend . The man , begin to discover certain things . Since here , he do n't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.<br /><br />Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot . Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and do n't novel . But " Birthday Girl " is just the opposite . This movie is full of good surprises , good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined . This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind . " Birthday Girl " have certain beauty and <unk> in its scenes , but at the same time , certain touching nature , and makes it so <unk> /><br <unk> Girl " is sometimes sad , sometimes funny , sometimes violent , but at the end , is totally satisfactory . And I 'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.<br /><br <unk> for the mistakes ... well , if there any .
0.0 <unk> in , flame out . That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell , a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon . I 'm not a fan of Japanese monster films , but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci - fi collection put out by Mill Creek / <unk> Films . It 's a great value at about twenty five bucks , so at fifty cents per movie , it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy <unk> /><br <unk> is <unk> from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast , and he 's not happy . Like Godzilla , he takes it out on Tokyo , setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet . They arrive at ' Plan Z ' , the hope of the world , and would n't you know it , there 's a scene where a huge shed is shown that 's called the ' Z Plan ' building ; that was a nice <unk> /><br />By the mid 1960 's , this country still was n't quite politically correct . One of the American military scenes at the <unk> Air <unk> <unk> has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee . I guess there were n't any privates around.<br /><br />Good old Gammera was quite the sight though , walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged . That 's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose <unk> of a hidden space ship , <unk> him off to Mars to save the world . High <unk> all around for the American and Russian team that made the save , now let 's get back to the Cold War.<br /><br />Like Godzilla , Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films , but having seen this one pretty much <unk> my interest in flying , flaming <unk> . Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has " Attack of the Monsters " with a featured guest appearance by the Big G. It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films ; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said ' Gammera , Sayonara ! "
1.0 Having just finished <unk> of the <unk> Knight mere minutes ago I find myself extremely please but questions still <unk> over me . While it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first <unk> of <unk> War the truth is that they really are n't . It would appear that the creator of <unk> had a different vision as to how the original ended ( and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur ) but I do not find that to be the case . <unk> does say it starts 5 years after the War of <unk> which <unk> was a part of . I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark 's story . Now , once the series does kick into Spark 's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years ( 15 years now since the War of <unk> ) . Spark and his crew do , in some cases , resemble <unk> and his crew once the journey kicks into gear , especially the love story that <unk> between Spark and <unk> . I also thought several times throughout <unk> that I threw in the original series and if it was n't for Spark 's long blue hair I know I would 've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in . By no means do I consider these major set backs however , the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline . The only thing that makes me hurt is that <unk> and <unk> return . <unk> ... how ? ? ? Do n't get me wrong both are great villains even though <unk> 's only villainous trait is that he supports the <unk> . Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part . As far as sequels go though , I highly recommend <unk> . I place both <unk> and , even more so , the original <unk> of <unk> War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Both of these are more epic than anything I 've ever seen or read . I highly recommend this .
1.0 Leonard Maltin must 've been watching some other movie . ( Though I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource , please disregard his comments on this one . ) He states " starts off well then <unk> " when it 's really the reverse - " starts off tepid then catches fire " . The plot is about as simple as it gets . Happy Mom , Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation at an isolated beach , Dad <unk> in accident , Mom runs off to get help , meets up with dangerous escaped convict . Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life.<br /><br />Good white - <unk> given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker , appearing suddenly ( the director , John Sturges , films it in a clever way that will make you gasp ) around halfway through as the cunning , desperate criminal . Meeker is an unusually flippant , reckless actor ( at least here and in the classic " Kiss Me Deadly " ) and he happily snatches the keys to the film 's narrative and speeds off with the top down . His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying " Pretty neat , huh ? " when he 's especially pleased with his <unk> . There is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he <unk> <unk> his hostage , Barbara Stanwyck , " Do n't go away " . She fires back " Where would I go ? " ( they 're in the middle of nowhere ) and he realizes sitcom - <unk> " Yeah , that 's right " . The friction between them is a <unk> /><br />There are flaws , somewhat ridiculous ones . There 's one scene where the police , who have been chasing after Meeker for some time , stop Stanwyck 's car and to evade detection Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would , and pretends to be asleep as she 's being questioned . A. He looks <unk> un - masculine in this pose and B. I think it 's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse <unk> /><br />Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and <unk> conclusion.<br /><br / >
1.0 This is yet another tell - it - as - it - is Madhur Bhandarkar film . I am not sure why he has this obsession to show Child <unk> and <unk> concepts to the Indian filmy audience , but I find some of those scenes really disgusting ! What 's new ? It is a nice piece put together by Bhandarkar , where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film , Mr & Mrs <unk> . What makes this movie different is , that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter <unk> with or is friends with , such as her <unk> , her colleagues , film stars , models , rich people and others featured in the Entertainment <unk> in her <unk> /><br <unk> : It is another good performance from Mrs <unk> . She is likely to be noticed for this role . She does selective roles but shines in them . She is noticeably de - <unk> and less beautiful in this film . But then , entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover , right ? Verdict : Madhur has come up with another good movie , that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely . However , this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to <unk> /><br />Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people ? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the REAL crime reporter ? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press ? or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and <unk> folk . The other concepts brought forth include the <unk> rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co - stars , if they wish to enter <unk> /><br />In addition , he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people , etc . He also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich <unk> /><br />This was all okay for me .. but might be too complex for an average movie - goer , who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
1.0 Tales from the Crypt : And All Through the House starts on Christmas Eve as Elizabeth ( Mary Ellen Trainor ) kills her husband Joseph ( Marshall Bell ) , she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news <unk> on the radio that says a homicidal maniac ( Larry Drake ) dressed as Santa Clause has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with Elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage ... <br /><br />This Tales from the Crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 , directed by the one of the show 's regular executive producers Robert Zemeckis And All Through the House is a decent enough watch . The script by Fred Dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic ' The <unk> of Horror ' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the <unk> horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt ( 1972 ) which starred Joan Collins as the murderous wife character here played by Ellen Trainor . This particular version is good enough but does n't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic . At only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace , the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & I quite liked the downbeat ending . This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt <unk> ( John <unk> ) segments complete with the usual <unk> /><br />Director Zemeckis does a good job & there 's a nice <unk> atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well . There 's not much gore here , someone has a poker stuck in their head , someone 's face is cut with an <unk> , someone 's arm is cut with an axe & there 's some blood splatter but generally speaking it 's not that graphic . The acting by a small cast is pretty good.<br /><br />And All Through the House is n't the best tale from the crypt but it 's a decent one all the same , worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this ?
1.0 The DVD for " <unk> <unk> " ( Castle of Blood ) is very odd . That 's because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into English from the French . Sometimes , characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene ! When I tried to get the film to be JUST subtitled or just dubbed , it made no difference ! Odd , but still <unk> /><br />The story purports to be based on a Poe story , though I ca n't recall which one . In fact , the character of Poe appears in the beginning and end of the film -- though it did n't look especially like him.<br /><br />A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he can not stay the entire night in a manner home . It seems like an easy bet to win -- even if the house is very creepy . However , it ca n't be that easy , as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died -- yet this fool STILL wants to make the wager ! While in the home , he meets lovely Barbara Steele within and falls madly for her . Later , however , he learns that she died more than a decade earlier ! How can this be ? ! I could tell you more about the plot but do n't want to spoil any of the suspense . See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.<br /><br />This film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere . The house , black & white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film . As for the plot , it 's interesting -- especially because there are many twists and turns -- so many that you are wondering just who is and who is n't among the undead by the end of the film.<br /><br />The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed . Crazy as it might sound , I felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary.<br /><br />Also , parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity . A strikingly beautiful woman appears topless , but it 's hardly necessary for the plot .
1.0 Theo Robertson has commented that <unk> did n't adequately cover the conditions after WWI which lead to Hitler 's rise and WWII.<br /><br />Perhaps he missed the first ONE and a quarter HOURS of volume 8 ? <unk> this period , and together with the earlier volumes in the series , shows clearly the existing conditions , I feel . A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period , joined the Hitler Youth even , and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in <unk> /><br />This documentary is SO far above the History Channel 's documentaries I also own , that there is no comparison.<br /><br />The ONLY fault , and it is a small one , that I have with <unk> is this : the numbers are not included , many times . For instance , if you 're talking about lend - lease , then how much war material was lent / <unk> ? How much to Russia , how much to <unk> ? How many merchant ships did the U - <unk> sink , and when ? How many ships did the German or Japanese Navy have , total , in 1941 ? What type were they ? How many troops ? How many troops did the allies have , in total , and by country ? Lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off , but I would have preferred MORE ! And naturally , I always want to see more military analysis . Like WHY did n't Patton & Clark trap the German army that was at <unk> , after they had it surrounded , instead of racing Monty to Rome , and letting it escape ? I do n't think you can begin to understand war until you 've seen some of these video segments on " total war " , like the fire bombing of <unk> . It 's like trying to understand Auschwitz , etc . , before you see the clips of the death camps : you just ca n't wrap your head around it - it 's too unbelievable.<br /><br <unk> at that time , and of course , <unk> , were the most egregious <unk> and <unk> of the Japanese , including cannibalism , ( read " <unk> " ) , and some LIVE <unk> of medical " experimentation " prisoners , <unk> any <unk> ! < br /><br <unk>
0.0 Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film , calling it , among other things , anti - feminist . She has also said on her radio show she hates making " romantic comedies " because she does n't believe in them . I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here . This film is a trifle at best . She does her best , but overall , it was just another boring , unbelievable " romantic comedy " that has no basis in the real world . Whereas there will be some who will say " suspend your disbelief " , one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood . Janeane 's character , for some reason , is usually filmed in shadows and darkness , which makes her look unattractive , while Uma 's character is filmed in lighter tones ( which probably <unk> Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she <unk> this film ) . That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two . As many have said here and on other comment threads , Janeane is not ugly , but in fact , quite beautiful . I have n't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking . Having said that though , I believe that Ben Chaplin 's character would more than likely stay with Uma , not Janeane . Many men do n't like really intelligent women ( and many women do n't like really intelligent men ) , and sadly , Ben probably would have stayed with Uma . And despite the director 's attempt to make Janeane unattractive , it does n't work . Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeane 's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character , and actually scoring with Janeane . Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here ( real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine ) , so take a cold shower gentlemen . This is the role that Janeane is best known for , and that 's a shame , as this really is n't that good of a film .
1.0 I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good , or how bad , a movie is . This film falls into the first category . Every year , I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars , even those that I know I wo n't like . " As It Is In Heaven " seems to fit the bill . The plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow .... For my tastes , which run more towards original , dark and/or daring foreign cinema ( Michael Haneke , Francois <unk> , A lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinema ) " As It Is In Heaven " does not sound particularly interesting .... It did n't get released in the USA , so I sat down to watch a <unk> I found in Singapore , preparing to " cross it off the list " . After a dull beginning , " As It Is In Heaven " becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen . Weak points : The characters in the film are pure " stock " characters- the <unk> <unk> , the Town Bully , the <unk> Wife , the Loose Woman <unk> for Love , the <unk> Minister .... Thankfully , they 're largely a likable bunch , as well as being well - written and well - acted . <unk> <unk> , as the minister 's wife <unk> , would have been nominated for an Oscar had her performance been in English . Strong points : the music is beautiful , and the main song , sung by Gabriella , is truly dramatic and memorable . And keep an eye out for the feisty <unk> old actress playing Olga , who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies ! I wo n't discuss the ending , but I will say that it makes sense . They 're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film , and you 're not quite sure why they 're happening . Although nothing is explained in words , it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo . * * * * out of * * * * * . Probably the strongest Swedish movie I 've ever seen .
1.0 Let 's start this review out on a positive note -- I am very glad they did n't decide to wimp out with Tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were <unk> . Actually , creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite . We do n't actually know if Tony will live or die . He 's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none . This episode seemed to move very slow , and the coma induced dream Tony was in involving mistaken identity and <unk> Asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely , flat - out weird . After <unk> I got a little sick of everyone grieving , but that <unk> ' t be a reason to slam this episode . It was a weird and unpredictable episode , but it was still well - written and intense . Edie Falco gave an astounding career - defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband 's could - be demise . I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and <unk> a vendetta against Junior , which AJ most likely wo n't have the balls to pull off . Silvio is now acting - boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes . There were a lot of great quips in this episode , also , and I think <unk> ' Pole - <unk> ' <unk> may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy <unk> /><br />This was n't a great episode and disappointed only because even though Tony kills people , we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show . This was a necessary episode for the series , even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion . Kudos to Edie Falco 's performance , and David Chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist . This is the only season of ' The Sopranos ' where I have n't a <unk> clue where it is going to go . I ca n't wait for next week 's episode . My Rating : 7.5/10 < br /><br />Best Line of the Episode : ( Paulie to AJ ) : " Let 's go , Van Helsing ! "
1.0 A mess of genres but it 's mainly based on Stephen Chow 's genre mash - ups for it 's inspiration . There 's magic kung - fu , college romance , sports , gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping . The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it 's easy to get past the many flaws in this film.<br /><br />A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court . A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that 's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but ca n't read . The old monk teaches the boy but <unk> when he tries to master the special technique in the manual . The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks . The new master gets mad at the now 20 + year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master 's weak punches and throws him out for the night . The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster 's club to play <unk> . This leads to a big fight , the boy 's <unk> from the monastery and the man 's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball <unk> /><br />Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes . Aside from the extreme <unk> storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie . The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over . The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film . I 'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end . The effects , photography and stunt work are all <unk> notch and make up for the uninspired plot . < br /><br />Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that 's not a good reason to ignore it . It 's quite entertaining even with a <unk> - shot ending . Recommended .
1.0 How could I possibly pass up the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together ? Well , I could n't and so , I rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man 's legend . I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was . Perhaps the fact that it was very , very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow , I found this story difficult to follow . Not because the story is complicated , but because it is slow . Even with a slow story , Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting , dimensional characters . < br /><br />Though I flounder to recommend this as a must see , it is a great story of Australian history ( considering how young the country is , this is very rare and should be appreciated ) and the film does have some good actions sequences . < br /><br <unk> see it for historical value .... <unk> right ... and that 's the only reason to see it ... ;) )
1.0 Fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression when people were having a tough time worldwide finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table . In Europe Hitler was on the rise , along with other <unk> socialist <unk> . In the United States seeds of the <unk> <unk> with the Federal <unk> Act and the income tax <unk> ( 16 ) were beginning to bear fruit for connected finance capitalists and their dominating secret societies . < br /><br />For the average guy and girl , times were tough . Enter Hollywood with at least some hopeful <unk> do n't think we can properly call them propaganda at this point , even though this particular movie revolves around war - <unk> naval exercises . The real issue for boys and girls then , as now , was how to hook up with the right one , lead a decent life , have wonderful children , with a modicum of grace and elegance . < br /><br />The odds were long . < br /><br /> ... <br /><br />For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews , please visit my site <unk> /><br />Brian Wright <unk> 2007
1.0 So often a band will get together for a re - union concert only to find that they just ca n't get it together . Not so here . This concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish . These three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone 's ego . This is obvious from the start , before they even step on stage . Many faces in the crowd were n't even born when these guys first performed . From the first song they capture that old magic that was Cream , 3 men , 3 instruments , no fuss . Clapton , by his own admission , said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no <unk> , <unk> etc so we get to see him at his best . Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many <unk> today , speak of him as some sort of drumming guru . Jack Bruce just great . They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come . This one 's a 10 for me .
1.0 I 'll keep this one quite short . I believe that this is an extraordinary movie . I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it 's badly written , poorly shot , has a terrible soundtrack and , worse , that it 's not real in its portrayal of life . OK , so it may not be quite believable for its whole length , but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed . Hope that it is n't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives . <unk> violence is real , right ? Is it right , no ! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised , rather than <unk> . I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times , each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving ( well not until 2008 anyway ) . 9 out of 10 from me for this one . It 's very nearly perfect in my view . <unk>
1.0 Its a shame she did n't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie <unk> had much more impact than <unk> , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S / M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S / M model that gets scared of her situation . Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , Those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . This is one film were both cuts should be made available . It seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .
1.0 There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie , but ca n't really do that can I ? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit , laugh , cry and then pee . I 'm serious . Do n't watch this movie if you 're easily offended by profanity , sex , nudity , homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature . Being a woman , and that might not even be a factor , I can watch this movie over and over again . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant . Along with all their other <unk> , I think <unk> is the prize winner . I 'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie . Watch the movie ! ! That 's all I 'm going to say . It 's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I 'm one of those people , like Ozzy Osbourne , who has a curse word in almost every line that <unk> out of their mouth when they speak . So I 'm keeping it professional . Best movie . Heck yeah ! !
1.0 Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them . As I watched this film , made in 1988 , in 1999 , I thought I was watching the <unk> Simpson debacle ( although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each <unk> /><br />The Australian news media , if this movie is to be believed , devoured the case of a possible <unk> and truth was left as an afterthought . It was scary to see the scenes of <unk> , swarming media hordes , ridiculous accounts of half - truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.<br /><br <unk> appalling is the media 's depiction as indifferent and <unk> of the technical information in the case . I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case ( the accused are Seven - Day <unk> /><br />Today these <unk> have become common but that makes the lesson only more <unk> /><br <unk> is excellent as usual , and this is the best I 've ever seen Sam Neill . The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible .
1.0 This movie has always been my <unk> Disney movie . Then on <unk> I saw the 30th <unk> of this movie DVD . WOW I remembered why I loved this movie . The DVD is So great , It has an extra 30 min that the original did not have . I did not know this when I first started watching . The movie made ever so much more since . The music they cut out should have been left in . You have not seen this movie until you have seen the Full <unk> min version . A lot of people say that the music is forgettable . I remember every song in this movie by heart , every song has it 's own Charm by it 's self , and comes together as a hole . I remember when i was younger I had the " Eglantine " song stuck in my head for days at a time . As well as " <unk> Sea " ( that song was meant for marry <unk> but was cut out of the film ) Please Watch the new uncut 30th <unk> movie and re - vote for this movie . the 10 that it really is .
1.0 To call this episode brilliant feels like too little . To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is <unk> too , 'cause there 's never been a far - from - great Sopranos episode so far . In fact , the title might be a smug invitation for those who are n't real fans yet : <unk> the Club ... <br /><br <unk> up where Junior left off ( putting a bullet in his nephew 's gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season ) , the story begins with Tony being absolutely fine . With no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him , he 's attending some kind of convention . Only he 's not speaking with his normal accent , and there seems to be something wrong with his papers : apparently , he is not Tony Soprano but Kevin <unk> , or at least that 's what a group of people think , and until the mess is sorted out he ca n't leave his <unk> /><br />Naturally , in pure Sopranos tradition , that turns out to be nothing but a dream : Tony is actually in a coma , with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate , his family and friends worried sick and Junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened . Unfortunately it did , and Anthony Jr. looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father 's life.<br /><br <unk> have popped up rather frequently in the series , often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists ( most notably in the Season Five show The Test Dream ) . <unk> the Club , however , takes the metaphysical qualities of the program , already hinted at by the previous episode 's use of a William S. Burroughs poem , and pushes the envelope in the most <unk> way : Tony hallucinating about his dead friends ( the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning , four seasons ago ) is one thing , him actually being in what would appear to be <unk> is radically different . The " heavenly " section of the story is crammed with allegorical <unk> , not least the name Tony is given ( as one character points out , spelling it in a certain way will give you the word " <unk> " ) , and none of it comes off as overblown or far - fetched : David Chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set - ups just for their own sake ; it all helps the narrative . Talking about " help from above " in the case of Tony Soprano might be stretching it a tad , though .
1.0 I saw this when it first came to video , my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time ... What stood out for me was the lack of mid - movie conflict that so many movies have , where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do n't say the one thing that you 're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal , that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . This is what I like the most about the movie I guess , that the main characters do n't do mean things to each other halfway through ... they do n't break up and make up , they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.<br /><br />These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track , they 're not that different . <unk> is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family , and <unk> was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . Anyway , I saw this movie posted on <unk> and had to watch it again ... sure there 's plot holes if you analyze the script and no , <unk> and <unk> should n't be eating hot dogs since they would have been <unk> in reality.<br /><br />Now , what detracts from the film is it 's unexpected scariness . Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. <unk> . And , the addition of him halfway through the movie ( though it 's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance ) is too abrupt ... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie , perhaps to show that it 's not that scary without the the dinosaurs . I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie , so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.<br /><br />Considering the target audience , who I 'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues ... I think I 'll give it a pass on those factors too , and just enjoy the story . It 's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind ... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be <unk> every 10 years I think .
1.0 Tarzan and his <unk> ) was the only Tarzan movie I did n't see when I was a kid . It sounded boring . Now I have seen it . I have seen the ape <unk> ) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive . It 's a remarkable movie . It 's almost flawless . Tarzan and his <unk> ) however , falters . It 's not <unk> and it 's parts tend to live a life of there own . The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great . Big budget expensive . Tarzan himself is co - starring . Jane dominates . She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead . Well . She let her be duped by a crock who <unk> a kiss from her and later murder an elephant . She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father . Forever . The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle . Stupid ? Later someone <unk> it in the river . Well it 's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead . Some cheap drama . The <unk> who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone . She takes their words for granted and want to be taken <unk> England ) . Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is , how hard he is to kill . The <unk> is leaving and Jane go along . Again a <unk> . She could easily make the <unk> rest for a few hours or more , to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband . She could be smart . She could dive where they found the floating bracelet , check the banks for traces . She can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in <unk> 's . <unk> up traces should n't be too hard for jungle Jane . She could talk to the apes , and so on . If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable . Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down . And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with " I blame myself as much as you " . A punishment for being <unk> perhaps ? Nonsense . <unk> , a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate . Still . This movie is far from bad even if the <unk> are many and sometimes deep . Just lean back and enjoy . It 's Tarzan and Jane for God sake .
1.0 " Let 's Bowl " started out on local television in the Twin <unk> . It came on late at night , something you 'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of <unk> /><br />Even the ads were locally produced , featuring Wally outside <unk> 's <unk> , holding a microphone and <unk> <unk> -- " Ahh ... over to you , Steve <unk> . " Not sure why , but that one always made me laugh.<br /><br />There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two <unk> , but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips . <unk> played it straight , counter - balanced by Rich <unk> 's bizarre and hilarious " Wally <unk> . " <unk> included segments like " How to <unk> <unk> of an Old <unk> Ball " ( <unk> them into a lake ) and " <unk> on <unk> , " where the duo " date " a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint , " I could have done that myself ! " < br /><br />Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn <unk> , <unk> out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor 's Falls , dressed in his tight pale blue <unk> and over - sized headphones . Hilarious ! < br /><br <unk> 's awestruck comments about " league <unk> , " and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also <unk> /><br <unk> 's Bowl " was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments , but the network never really knew what to do with it , running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling " competition , " which was never the point of the show . The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ( Ernie , the Pig , Butch , etc . ) were more distractions than anything else . The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced . Even Jon Stewart <unk> Let 's Bowl on the Daily Show -- ( not enough lame , snide jokes ? ) -- an <unk> treatment for a show that deserved far better.<br /><br />How often does a " Let 's Bowl " come along in the world of modern television , a locally <unk> mix of comedic genius and total crap ? The networks have the " total crap " part down cold , but it 's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark , strange , funny little gem like " Let 's Bowl . " < br /><br />Here 's hoping they 'll put it out on DVD .
1.0 Nicely done , and along with " New <unk> " it 's a great continuation ! <unk> to see James <unk> in the latest episode " <unk> " Check it out ! < br /><br />I like the growing characterisation , and think we have good <unk> for the TV actors in a fan - produced piece . This show manages to capture the feel quite well , as they state on the <unk> , it has improved over the years with experience and I hope with some more experience , a strong script editor , and a pick - up in timing and CGI that <unk> will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is!<br /><br />Good work to all <unk> /><br />(I have a HUGE soft spot for <unk> & <unk> ( GREAT acting ) , although I 'm a bit tired of " <unk> 's laws " . <unk> already ! Shelby 's great ( if a little uptight ) and it 's cool she got the ship . Commodore Ian 's nice ( like Fred <unk> ) , but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself . The Doc , <unk> , and <unk> are right on the money in my eyes , as is the WONDERFUL <unk> ( what a beautiful accent - a REAL Russian ! ( Well , I 'm guessing Rene <unk> from the Czech <unk> /><br />It gets my vote , and the CGI is <unk> . Some of the <unk> 's obvious , but on a small budget <unk> /><br />Really glad I found it!<br /><br <unk> , some of the acting is n't great but it 's fan - made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry <unk> . <unk> /><br />The gay material is <unk> on too thick ( Graham <unk> be embarrassed ) . Trek does n't pay that much attention to <unk> couples so why <unk> gays with all the <unk> ? It 's not necessary to <unk> someone 's sexuality to this extent - I hope they tone it down & let <unk> & Zen be people not <unk> - I do n't treat my gay friends any differently , They 're just regular guys.<br /><br <unk> it 's a mixed bag . I can tell its all stock Trek <unk> stuff and works most of the time , but timing can fall flat now & then ( the end of " Worst <unk> Part 2 " misses the <unk> , and the edit . Love the fact they use the " Galaxy Quest " <unk> /><br />I certainly ca n't wait for more ! ! <unk> < br /><br <unk> give up , never <unk> /><br <unk> les <unk>
1.0 Jonathan Demme 's directorial debut for Roger Corman 's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks - in - chains 70 's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid . <unk> Russ Meyer starlet Eric ( " Vixen , " " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " ) Gavin gives a robust , winning performance as a brassy , resilient new fish who does her best to <unk> in a grimy , hellish <unk> . The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean , crippled , sexually frustrated warden ( her erotic dream about doing a slow , steamy <unk> in front of the lady inmates is a real <unk> ) . <unk> favorite 70 's B - movie actress Roberta ( " The <unk> , " " <unk> <unk> " ) Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward , foul - mouthed <unk> <unk> who tells a gut - busting dirty joke about <unk> . Lynda Gold ( a.k.a . <unk> <unk> of Tobe Hooper 's " <unk> Alive " and Curtis Harrington 's " Ruby " ) makes her lively film debut as uninhibited <unk> Crazy Alice . And the ever - cuddly Cheryl " <unk> " Smith does a lovely , touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from " <unk> : A Child 's Tale of the <unk> . " < br /><br />Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language , nudity , rape and violence , it 's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth ; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men <unk> exploit women and strongly asserts the pro - feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force . Demme 's <unk> , confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of <unk> observed incidental details and delightful moments of <unk> quirky human behavior . Furthermore , both <unk> <unk> 's vibrant cinematography and John <unk> 's marvelously <unk> oddball blues score are 100 % on the money excellent . Patrick Wright ( Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap - rubber - monster - suit creature feature <unk> " Track of the <unk> " ) has a <unk> bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom . <unk> , rousing and immensely enjoyable , " <unk> Heat " qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70 's drive - in movie fans .
1.0 Robert Altman should n't make a movie like this , but the fact that he <unk> and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly - wound thriller in that paperback - tradition of Grisham <unk> shows a versatility that is commendable . In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that , unfortunately , he is n't always very successful at , or at least it 's not the first thing on his <unk> as director : plot . There 's one of those big , juicy almost pot - boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low - class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways , twists and plot ensues , yada yada . And it 's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these " I saw that coming from back there ! " endings , or just a such a semi - conventional thriller.<br /><br />But it 's a surprise that pays off because , oddly enough , Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior , or rather is able to unintentionally <unk> it out of a very well - cast ensemble , of a small - town <unk> environment . The film drips with atmosphere ( if not total superlative craftsmanship , sometimes it 's good and sometimes just decent for Altman ) , as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and <unk> and rain keep things soaked and <unk> and <unk> . So the atmosphere is really potent , but so are performances from ( sometimes ) hysterical Kenneth <unk> , Embeth <unk> as the ' woman ' who lawyer <unk> gets caught up with , and Robert Downey Jr ( when is he * not * good ? ) as the private detective in <unk> 's employ . Did I neglect Robert Duvall , who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad - vibes of the picture on ? < br /><br />As said , some of the plot is a little weak , or just kind of standard ( lawyer is divorced , bitter custody battle looms , innocent and goofy kids ) , but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material , something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow . If it 's not entirely masterful , it still works on its limited terms as a what - will - happen - next mystery - Southern - noir .
1.0 * <unk> /><br />This is only the second pay - per - view I 've given a perfect 10 , the first being the 1991 Royal Rumble . It was full of exciting matches that were n't memorable , just disposable fun . And that 's why I love it.<br /><br />The opening match between Razor and DiBiase , as well as <unk> <unk> vs. Marty <unk> were the only low points . They were OK matches , but DiBiase deserved better in his final pay per view match . These days , a match like this would have run - ins and a bigger climax for Razor 's first major <unk> push . And <unk> , fresh off a Intercontinental title run , could have had a better match with <unk> . But I do n't think anyone really cared . They just needed a <unk> push on pay per view television.<br /><br <unk> and The Kid were great , as were Michaels and Perfect . I wish Perfect could have won , but Michaels lies down for no one . Notice how right after this , he left the WWF so he would n't have to job to Razor . Bret Hart had two great <unk> with <unk> ( notice how everyone 's best match is against the Hit - man ) and then Lawler . Their rivalry was a classic ; that 's why that year 's <unk> of the Year was a no - brainer . How often do you see two legends win <unk> of the Year this late in their <unk> /><br />The <unk> - Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year . Who knew the Bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams <unk> /><br />Many say that the Undertaker - Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time . But I loved it . Remember , what made the old WWF ( as in , pre - WWE ) great was the mix of athleticism and freak show . Is there a soul out there who did n't like <unk> /><br />The main event was n't bad , although nowhere near match of the year status . They put Lex Luger over well , but made a wise choice in having Yokozuna keep the belt . He was the first heel since Superstar Graham to hold the belt for more than two months . Nowadays , heels are <unk> all the time . But from the beginning of the <unk> through the WWF of the 90s , if you <unk> , you missed a heel title <unk> /><br />As an old school wrestling fan , this one and <unk> ' 88 are my favorites .
1.0 I really wanted to like this film and I do n't think I was terribly disappointed . Being an American History teacher , I felt an obligation , almost , to see this film and as far as the history went , it was n't bad . Sure there were a few mistakes here and there ( especially with the timeline -- the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year -- not over six years of actual fighting ) , but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent . Unfortunately , the movie ALSO included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor <unk> and a rich <unk> . For the most part , it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed " tacked <unk> a plot device instead of a real honest - to - goodness romance . In fact , as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of " love at fist sight " , it was kind of annoying the more I think about it.<br /><br />However , in spite of this romance , the film is truly interesting and inspiring --- plus , in so many ways it seems as if the much later film , THE <unk> , was copied from this Griffith film ! ! ! Both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the British and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians -- and both having the secret intention of using this as a " <unk> " to starting their OWN nation in the America ! ! ! The only major difference is that this film is set in the North and THE <unk> was in the <unk> . It sure would have been nice if Mel Gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to D. W. Griffith for the story ideas . It just does n't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other.<br /><br />PS -- Despite me liking this film and some other of Griffith 's films , he DOES deserve to once again " burn in hell " for his having White actors portray all the Black servants in the film ! This is a sick and bigoted thing that Griffith did in so many of his films -- especially in BIRTH OF A <unk> . I got ta assume based on this and the way he portrays Blacks that he was A - OK with slavery and was quite the <unk> for this " quaint institution " ( do n't get mad at me -- this IS meant as sarcasm ) .
1.0 IN COLD BLOOD has to be ranked as first - rate movie - making , even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make - believe , but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work , based as it is on a true - life crime <unk> /><br />It opens with Quincy Jones ' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City , effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end . The B&W photography of Conrad Hall does a superb job right from the start.<br /><br />Also clear from the start : <unk> <unk> and <unk> Wilson are natural born actors . They do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill . " Ever see a millionaire <unk> in the electric hair ? Hell no . There are two kinds of rules in this world . One for the rich and one for the poor , " says Wilson , taking a <unk> of alcohol behind the <unk> /><br />Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family , showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind.<br /><br <unk> , reminiscing about movies , and thinking of hunting for gold in Mexico , says : " Remember Bogart in ' Treasure of the Sierra <unk> ' ? " ( An ironic moment , because Blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets ) . " I got you <unk> for a natural born killer , " Wilson tells <unk> /><br <unk> <unk> is one of the lead detectives on the case , discovering that all four family members were tied up , shot in the head and one had his throat cut . " Do n't people around here lock doors ? " asks <unk> <unk> . " They will tonight , " is the <unk> <unk> /><br />After the murders , the killers discover that there was " no big fat safe in the wall " , like their prison informant told them . So , in the end , it was truly a stupid , senseless crime . The question is : WHY did they do it ? And this is something the second half of the film explores in depth . It takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the <unk> /><br />It 's these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they 've made numerous mistakes and left a living witness . The actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end . " It makes no sense , " Blake tells Forsythe . " Mr. Cutter was a very nice gentleman . I thought so right up until the time I cut his throat . " The screenplay by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point -- and so is his direction.<br /><br />Summing up : Brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere $ 43 . Chilling .
1.0 In my line of work , I occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to <unk> their film . When I can , I take a look at these low - budget films and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs . Once in a while , though , there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire , as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible . The short film B R O K E N , directed by Alex Ferrari , is a genuine surprise and worth a second look.<br /><br <unk> in at a scant 20 minutes , B R O K E N tries to tell a compelling ( but surreal ) story with almost no back story . The audience is <unk> down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening . A young woman ( Samantha Jane <unk> ) awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home . When she awakes , she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book . These nasty guys and girls are larger than life . They are all guns and knives . There is no way out.<br /><br />The kicker here is that , despite being a low budget film it does n't play like one . From the very beginning , the feeling is that B R O K E N has been shot , edited , and produced by professionals . It looks like something Quentin Tarantino might have done on his day off when he was <unk> with the Wachowski brothers . The film is sharp and cool , it looks good and it feels like something <unk> /><br />The acting is much better than I usually see in these smaller films . <unk> and Paul Gordon ( who plays the head killer , Duncan ) were well chosen . As two of the few speaking roles in the film , it is up to them to carry the film . No special effects , no matter how good , would have saved this film from bad acting . Thankfully , <unk> manages to convey true fear and Gordon manages to come off as a real psycho . Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent , but it hardly shows.<br /><br />The downside to B R O K E N is that it 's only 20 minutes long . The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle . Watching it , I felt like I was supposed to have some epiphany , but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than I had hoped it would be . The film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop , but it comes off as unsatisfying . I keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film.<br /><br <unk> RATING : 8 out of 10 .
1.0 My name is John <unk> and this is my story about Paperhouse : In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcock 's psycho , I was very scared and deeply disturbed . I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way . But none where satisfactory . Amongst those tried and failed were The Birds , Night of the Living Dead , The Silence of the Lambs , The Blair Witch Project , Ring , The Evil Dead , The Sixth Sense , 28 Days Later , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Halloween , Near Dark , Alien , Peeping Tom , The Cell , Rosemary 's Baby , Do n't Look Now , <unk> General , Friday the 13th and The Omen . That should confirm I was desperate ! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse <unk> .<br /><br <unk> is based on a favourite book that I own , called Marianne Dreams . Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films , but they did n't tell me about the link between book and film . I discovered the truth while on the Internet , I bought the film later that day.<br /><br />I thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull . <unk> it certainly was but dull certainly not . It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same . One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book ( nothing remarkable about that ) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house ( and I mean genuinely unnerving ) . More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the <unk> , <unk> an apple tree . Anna draws into the <unk> a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world . Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house , <unk> Anna draws in a <unk> ( a place to go to ) but still the problem remains mark ca n't walk . So Anna decides to draw her father in . she gets her pencil out and gets too work , but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes . <unk> " he looks like madman " . So Anna tries to rub him out and start again , but the pencil proves indelible ( that means nothing can be rubbed out ) . Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father 's eyes ! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br <unk> truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on <unk> Street ! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset . But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years . The question is how dose the compare with Psycho ? Answer , 1 the old dark house , 2 psychological parental fears , 3 a genuine shock , 4 and very scary music .
1.0 this was the most <unk> film , when produced . Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were both distressed by its poor ratings --- for good reason . it was and remains far ahead of its time . aside from the seemingly poor direction , probably editing , at the very beginning , the work moves along to a stunning conclusion.<br /><br <unk> its Sir Ralph Richardson 's ' Boss ' role , or even better , his wife 's , Sir Cedric 's , as adversary to space - <unk> , Raymond Massey 's ' John Cabal ' center role --- all deliver mind - boggling performances.<br /><br />the scene with mr . Korda 's incomparable set , of the small girl - child , running out to an absolutely ' never - to - be - matched ' scene , commenting ' Life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier ' ? that swiftly brings tears to any parent / <unk> . this is not a film for the young -- unless ' experienced ' and rather those who have seen ' the horror ' it <unk> /><br <unk> , the ' phony - <unk> ' , looks hokey --- while using a ' magnetic - cannon ' , now termed ' mass - driver ' may be viewed as ridiculous , vs. rockets --- give Sir Korda a break -- Mr . Wells made that choice . and at + <unk> $ 8 million , this film went way beyond ' over - <unk> he concentrated on what he could <unk> /><br />the true power of this Greatest of cinema rests in ' John Cabal 's ' final statement of human destiny --- his friend ' Passworthy ' doubts the wisdom of space - <unk> , saying , ' We 're such little animals . ' John Cabal 's proper response <unk> ) ' Yes , little animals , and if that is all we are , we must live and die as such . ' they are standing under a large <unk> telescope . he sweeps his hand over the night sky . ' Yet we may have all the Universe , or <unk> the final chorus breaks <unk> shall it <unk> is not ' Star Wars ' , ' Blade <unk> you may consider ' <unk> is the Real <unk> /><br />i remind all of Steven <unk> 's most recent address , upon his latest ' Medal of <unk> must leave Earth , or <unk> very core of this work --- i love ' standard <unk> this ' relic ' , for the wise viewer , offers far more . ' Which Shall It Be ? ' be in the proper ' <unk> that takes --- this will take your breath away --- i ' <unk> , for humanity ? the most significant of cinema . < br /><br <unk> posting , i note many have commented on the poor ' media - quality ' of ' surviving ' examples . in the 80 's i developed a ' <unk> ' ' <unk> ' process which required a ' clean ' original . this led me to Michael Korda , who sadly noted all were gone --- so we must relish what <unk> but true ? '
1.0 <unk> , <unk> /><br />Many people told me that « Planet of the Apes » was Tim Burton 's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film . So I decided not to see it . Another friend of mine who had n't seen the movie yet , advised me to watch it in spite of this because ` a Tim - Burton - movie is still a Tim - Burton - movie ' . I decided to do it , and I found that he was right.<br /><br />It 's clear that a remake of such a famous film as ` Planet of the Apes ' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking . Still , Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as ` <unk> ' or ` Batman ' . If you are already fond of Burton - movies , it 's hard not to like one of his films , even if it has some flaws : nerve - <unk> monkey <unk> , over - dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been , without difficulties , replaced by <unk> else.<br /><br />What the film gives us in the first place , is an answer to the question : What 's the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake ? First of all , Burton would n't be Burton , if he would n't refuse to call it a remake from the start ; it 's a ` re - imagining ' . On the other hand , Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston ( as human ) , and he knows that a remake does n't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared . So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film , <unk> <unk> by referencing to quotes . <unk> the story - line , Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first , and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  AND HERE IS THE SPOILER  Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever . < br /><br />Now , this is the <unk> answer to people 's expectations they hold because of the astonishing , shocking ending of the first ` Planet of the Apes ' . An ending , even more unexpected , more astonishing and : completely confusing , because  and here I 'm <unk> with various ` Planet of the <unk> and <unk>  it does not make any sense . There can not be a meaning to it , or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective . Tim Burton is playing his cruel games , he does it with a grin and he does it well . Burton fans will sure like it , others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of <unk> . Well , and I do n't think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again 
1.0 A few years ago , a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the Michael Mann film ' Heat ' on it . After we finished that movie , and were about to stand up , we saw that there is another film just after , tough on the cassette 's envelope the owner did n't write it up . Yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening , which lacked credits.<br /><br />Some two hours later , I just sat there wondering : how could I not have heard of this masterpiece <unk> ... <br /><br />This film was Europa . Lars von Trier woke film noir from the dead , deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets , yet often there was haunting similarity with post - war German photographs I saw . And then the tricky <unk> /><br />The story itself is a hard - to - take moral odyssey that has no happy end . A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post - war Germany , intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his <unk> dropped . But he mostly meets distrust and self - destructive defiance . He hires with Zentropa , a dining - and - sleeping - car company ( modeled on <unk> ) , whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators the <unk> <unk> . Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf , Nazi post - war terrorists . When he does n't understand the world ( or just Europeans ) anymore , in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just <unk> /><br />As a final note , for historical correctness : in the real world , the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies , they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup . After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied - occupied <unk> , two months before the <unk> , the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of <unk> and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines , the Werewolf . But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training , and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected <unk> or forced - <unk> foreigners in <unk> villages to <unk> lasting fear on inhabitants , with Hitler 's death and the war 's end it all fell apart.<br /><br />However , the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the <unk> . They feared the Werewolf everywhere , suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later ( ignored by some recent pseudo - historians ) . For example , when a gas main exploded in the police <unk> of bombed - out <unk> , or when the Soviet military commander died in a <unk> accident in Berlin . The effect was strongest on the Soviets , who arrested tens of thousands ( in large part children ! ) ' <unk> ' on suspicion of being Werewolf , and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died .
1.0 The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary <unk> across the garbage dump where the characters live . The film is based on a series of stories by <unk> Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump . It 's a mix of laughter and <unk> /><br />First color film made by <unk> <unk> has been something I 've wanted to see for a long time . <unk> it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material . I was holding out for the full version , waiting to see what <unk> wanted us to see , only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version.<br /><br />Finally sitting down to see the film last night I 'm of mixed emotions about the film . First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed . You can see every other of <unk> remaining six films reflected in this movie , down to the painted <unk> . Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with ( of course there are failed projects as well ) . The film is a visual work of <unk> be warned if you 're going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot <unk> so will appear in normal TV ratio . ) The rest of the film is a mixed bag . Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people do n't quite come together . As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they do n't hang as one . I do n't blame <unk> since one ca n't always hit things out of the box , especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi - character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself.<br /><br />This is n't to say that there are n't reasons to see the film . As will all <unk> films there are always reasons to see his films , whether they work or not . The first trip of the " <unk> " is one of the best things <unk> ever did and is worth the price of a rental . Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the <unk> is <unk> and taken out . The father and son living in the car is touching ( though ultimately very sad ) and there are other bits and pieces that shine ( like the cast which is across the board great ) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime <unk> /><br />Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers <unk> /><br <unk> 6 and 7 as a whole , much higher in pieces .
1.0 This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society , rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life . In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool 's Junior <unk> <unk> the opening title points out that 92 % of potential delinquents , who have been dealt with under this scheme , have not committed a second crime . However , this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen - drama until the film 's epilogue where we are instructed that we should n't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed - up they might <unk> /><br <unk> Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of <unk> <unk> Officer . This hard - boiled character is a role typical of Baker . Having been currently on the trail of a notorious <unk> known as the <unk> and does not relish the distraction of the transfer . However , as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events , back to his original <unk> /><br />His first case leads him to the home of two young children , Mary and Patrick Murphy ( played by real - life brother and sister duo ) , who have committed a petty theft . Here he meets <unk> ( <unk> portrayed by Anne <unk> ) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with . It quickly becomes obvious that the <unk> environment of such inner - city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile <unk> /><br />The elder brother of the Murphy family , Johnny , is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums . McCallum does an eye - catching turn as the Americanized mixed - up kid , who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando , than any previous British star . One is reminded of Brando 's character Johnny from ' The Wild One ' who led a leather - clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film 's ' Johnny ' leads his <unk> /><br />Thankfully the <unk> of earlier <unk> crime dramas such as ' The Blue <unk> ' is not so apparent . Instead we are presented with several well drawn - out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between <unk> and Baker takes the <unk> /><br />The plot , whilst at times predictable , does deliver some memorable scenes . The <unk> influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music , leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant . The most <unk> memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children , including Mary and Patrick , are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny . Obviously in the light of the real - life <unk> Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying . Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences .
1.0 The saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and NO - ONE felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message <unk> /><br />Made the same year as Philadelphia ... the Tom Hanks Oscar - winner ... this is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to . There is more humanity , life , love , tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film I have seen ... and it is all true.<br /><br />In order for this to be printed I need to leave a few more lines of text : suffice it to say that anyone who REALLY wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60 's and 70 's , and to understand just what AIDS was like before the modern drug " <unk> " allowed people to breathe a little easier ... this is the film to see . < br /><br />Oh , and I will add a personal comment about AIDS . Despite everything , there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror . When AIDS first arrived , it was called the " gay cancer " , and governments preferred to " let them die " rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of <unk> . Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease . But the government was n't ready for that ; So when straight people began getting ill too , the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves ( examples : The <unk> Project : the <unk> <unk> all those who died of AIDS ; Act Up etc ) The result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them , because no other organizations existed . This close contact , in my estimation , is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals . When AIDS first came on the scene , many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us ... and that probably would have been true if <unk> did n't suddenly become ill too ; nevertheless , the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that , as I write this , there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without AIDS to bring us together . It is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what I am writing here is true , and I think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain .
1.0 The main problem I see with this film is its score , which screams with every note , " This is a cheap - ass movie . " There 's not much more to say here . The score just plain <unk> /><br />The second problem , which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the <unk> of the plot near the end of the film ( one of the the money shots , if you will ) , is the dialogue between Martha ( Adrienne Barbeau ) and the <unk> man ( Richard <unk> ) , in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment . At all times during this dialogue , the viewer is very much aware that s / he is listening to a movie dialogue . In other words , suspension of disbelief breaks down here . The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a <unk> - <unk> stuffing of information the movie makers wish to <unk> to the audience.<br /><br />The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau . While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre , I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch . The main point of her performance that did n't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo - like woman on a mission . This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress , and one can not place too much blame , therefore , upon Barbeau . To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part , however , I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.<br /><br />Finally , the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor , most notably during its horror flashes . I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a <unk> of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />So what 's my <unk> <unk> of this piece ? I 'd give it a solid <unk> to B- , depending upon how much credit you 're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget . Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems , the film is <unk> on the solid plot of the <unk> side of Nazi mysticism . I see no problems with plot development or coherence ; the dialogue , with the noted exception above , is downright brilliant in places , especially the all important <unk> scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie ; as mentioned , the creep factor was well crafted , if a bit <unk> in the second half ; and Nicholas Brendan , who also associated produced , delivered a wonderful performance.<br /><br />All in all , this film is definitely worth the view --- see it with a Nazi you love . :)
1.0 Nick Cage is Randall Raines , a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he 's forced to save his the life of his brother Kip ( Giovanni Ribisi ) when he screws up on a job , by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night . He has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch . But the cops are onto him , so can he pull it off ? This was one of the great candidates of a film to re - make as the Original was far from a classic . And if you do n't go into it expecting much , and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole <unk> just take the movie for what it is . You 'll end up enjoying the ride . Watch it on a double - bill with " The Fast and the Furious " for a night of high - speed hijinks , just do n't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.<br /><br />My Grade : B- < br /><br />DVD Extras : 7 minute Jerry Bruckheimer Interview ; Bruckheimer <unk> / <unk> ; Action <unk> : <unk> <unk> ; The Big Chase ; " 0 To 60 " featurette ; " Wild <unk> " featurette ; Stars On The Move ; The Cult " <unk> On The Heart " music video ; Theatrical Trailer , and Trailers for " Shanghai Noon " , " Mission to Mars " and " Coyote Ugly "
0.0 I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November ! It looked awesome and the songs ! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it ! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together . It has a multi cast of 12 people ! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film . I think the director , Nikhil Advani , has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him . Compared to Nikhil 's directorial <unk> ' <unk> Ho <unk> Ho ' , ' Salaam - e - Ishq ' falls quite behind . I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast . I think the best factors of this film is the songs ! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome , <unk> - <unk> - Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years . I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs ! One thing I was disappointed with , is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by <unk> Khan and <unk> <unk> . I found this extremely rude watching this with family ! Although , some may find this nude as comedy , it is not something you would want to watch with parents ! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall , I think its an alright movie !
1.0 Scientist working frantically in <unk> finds a way to locate the impact <unk> of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element . All ( <unk> and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there , including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly <unk> . When he <unk> his rivals <unk> had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery , they propose a ' joint ' expedition to Africa ... of course they end up stealing much of <unk> . Rukh 's original discovery , giving him only <unk> credit . In addition to that , an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst <unk> ( Lawton ) literally steals <unk> . Rukh 's young trophy wife ( Drake ) , who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being . Having grown horns like a deer was n't going to make <unk> . Rukh ( Karloff ) any <unk> , so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission ... killing 2 of his foes and friendly <unk> . Benet ( Lugosi ) , the only one who had helped him ... finally <unk> to the deadly <unk> that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost <unk> ) <unk> the <unk> and that poor excuse for a human being she had married . Acting is mostly fine , with Karloff & Lugosi being very good . Check the hysterical <unk> scene ... Other characters are n't worth mentioning ... Recommended , much like ALL old Universal horrors ...
1.0 Hardly a masterpiece . Not so well written . Beautiful cinematography i think not . This movie was n't too terrible but it was n't that much better than average . The main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was ... should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically " because mom says we ca n't . " Some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters . Couple times i was wondering if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas ' classic American Graffiti . Not that it 's wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that , i mean come on ! Worst part of this was that <unk> Amick had such a small part , i mean double come on ! ! She was the only one , in one or two lines , who actually tried a southern accent . ( Take a good listen , it was there even though her character was from California ! <unk> ! ! ) Maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie . Oh well , what can ya do when you have a director who 's just a director and not an artist , also . Too bad . Overall i give this a B- and that 's being a little generous 'cause i 'm partial to Ms. Amick .
1.0 Having looked at some of the other comments here , I have a main complaint with this presentation . < br /><br />The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful " victim , " and the handsome , obviously extremely " off - center , " blue - collar protagonist ( if just short of " totally - deranged " ) - take turns beating the hell out of each other , sort of like a Caucasian <unk> <unk> /><br />This is all right , and this is , of course , mainly a " turning - the - tables " story . However , my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught - up in his desire to display Farrah 's well - known and obvious physical attributes . Beginning with her being <unk> clad in a thin robe , and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes , these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.<br /><br />Her roommates I 'm certain give performances as written and directed - however , their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing , do n't ring true -- based upon Farrah 's previous experience with this guy , the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions , and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has <unk> /><br />But this is a film and story , compelling as much in spite of , as because of , the director 's work .
1.0 Greetings again from the darkness . This one will be compared to " The Princess Bride " and although it does n't measure up to that classic , it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right . The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained , but the execution is fine , even building up strong suspense.<br /><br />Charlie Cox plays Tristan , who falls for the wrong girl ( <unk> Miller ) , and agrees to <unk> her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes . Not much suspense on what happens with these two , but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the <unk> necklace our " star " is wearing . Lots of bad chasing the good.<br /><br />Along the way , an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see ( including any from the <unk> ) . Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside , and shall we say in touch with his feminine side . Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky <unk> as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.<br /><br />Not your typical chase , coming of age , or fantasy film , but director Matthew Vaughn 's ( " <unk> <unk> " ) effort deserves an audience . Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money . My guess it will find big success on video .
0.0 This was a fairly creepy movie ; I found the music to be effective for this . The photographs Mario took of the village were also unnerving . However , I had three problems with this film . One is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on , but this may have just been my copy . The second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and I 'm still not sure what was going on there . The third problem is that I did n't understand the ending , but apparently some people do . Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things , and the male lead is very 70s . All in all , watchable but not even close to being a favorite .
0.0 The script is nice . Though the casting is absolutely non - watchable . No style . the costumes do not look like some from the High <unk> society . Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow , though in Ms. Paltrow 's acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse . Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions , he is romantic and not at all sharp - looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV - version . <unk> spectator can not see at all Mr. Elton - Ms . Smith relationship 's development as it was in the motion version , so one can not understand where was all Emma 's trying of make a Elton - Smith match ( besides of the portrait ) .
1.0 The film notes describe the main role family , as Turkish immigrants which living in Denmark . However , it is so clear to understand that the fact is , the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute <unk> . Similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on Turkey today on <unk> ethnicity societies . What a worry ... <br /><br />It is widely accepted issue in Turkey today , the <unk> immigrants living in European <unk> today , which have moved from Turkey at 70 's are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system , by growing daughters and women under pressure , are giving harm to the Turkish International Image . Also , as same as widely accepted another issue is the Turkish or <unk> immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the Community Europe <unk> .
1.0 True , it does not follow the book very closely , but it 's still a very entertaining take on the story . Swayze was far better in the role than I expected . And Doody avoided the " silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness " portrayal most of us probably expected ( <unk> . Kate Capshaw in " Indiana Jones & the Temple of <unk> /><br />At any rate , it 's amazingly better than Richard Chamberlain 's awful pair of Quatermain <unk> /><br />It is very reminiscent of a western in many ways . About the only thing I did n't care for was all the mysticism , but I guess that is part and <unk> of the genre . Like " how can you have an African adventure story without witch <unk> and <unk> wise wandering <unk> ? " <unk> .
1.0 So I do n't ruin it for you , I 'll be very brief . There 's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast . A young graduate of Harvard <unk> School ( Brian White ) finds out he does n't know as much as he thinks about people . He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his <unk> because a girlfriend ( <unk> ) left him for a job as a TV Producer . His Senior Resident ( Wood Harris ) , helped marvelously by his ' creative <unk> <unk> ) bring him up to speed . They help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money ( as seems to be true for many of my pre - <unk> friends ) .
1.0 I liked the quiet noir of the first part , the acting of Pacino and Cusak , especially their scenes together . The moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old <unk> and the idealistic youth was effecting . I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie ; she was an earnest and appealing character . The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the <unk> to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly did n't want him meddling in . Nobody in their right mind would meet a <unk> on an abandoned dock in a junkyard . Here the story became implausible . Something that I do n't understand : why did the cop and <unk> have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge ?
1.0 This is the only movie I 've seen Prince in but it do n't matter . And I thought he was only great at singing boy was I wrong . This is probably his best performance . The music is great . That s why it won the Oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie ( or something like that ) . Now he has an Oscar and <unk> under his belt . Although the cursing gets in the way with the film ( just make sure no little kids or in the room ) . There is n't to much to say without revealing the plot . You should really go out and get this movie your collection is n't complete unless you got this movie in it . What else could I possibly say except for go and get this movie now !
0.0 The story of the film was as simple minded as its morality : Go find a girl , marry her , live with her happily ever after . Though the film had some fine moments and turns , most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline.<br /><br />The Baptist / Mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about , probably intentionally . A more interesting story would have been a mixed <unk> /><br />If you wanna see a film which does n't need too much concentration , which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values ( besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-) ) , you will be fine with this film . Might be shown at a family - home - evening ...
0.0 Blood Surf AKA <unk> is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller , <unk> <unk> , Kate Fischer , Duncan <unk> , Joel West , Matt Borlenghi , Maureen <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Susan Africa , Archie <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . The acting by the actors is fairly good . The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed fairly good as well . Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end . This is a fairly thrilling film . If you the the cast in the film , Monsters , Giant Animal films , Horror , Thrillers , Mystery , and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today !
1.0 Got ta start with Ed Furlong on this one . You got ta . God bless this kid . $ 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he 's really like in real life . He has a one - liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script . You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it does n't even seem like Furlong is even acting . Maybe that 's why his performance was good . Same with Madsen . You keep thinking , " I bet this guy is really like this in real life . " Does Madsen even have to act ? Just natural . Vosloo has obviously moved on from the type - casted Mummy guy . I think the biggest surprise to this film was <unk> <unk> 's performance . Her reactions are spot - on in this film . I <unk> if she was hot or not , but realized I would just like to see more of her . < br /><br />Not a big fan of shoot 'em out / hostage type films . But what I am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing . It 's not just your standard robbers take over a bank , they kill hostages , and the good guys win in the end type of film . The twists keep on coming ... and <unk> /><br />The café scenes work best with the hand - held <unk> to show what it 's really like in there . Not glossed over a bit . Think like Bourne Ultimatum " lite " style on some scenes in the <unk> /><br />And for those Bo <unk> fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne ( who plays Karl ) will make you do a double take . These guys are <unk> /><br />As I watched I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town . Made sense in the end that these people <unk> stuff to other countries / states so they might have these accents . But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for International audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of . And some of them are smoking hot . <unk> Dean ? Need I say more .
1.0 While to most people watching the movie , this will be of little interest , but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another , this one is probably the best in many ways.<br /><br />From The Golem to The <unk> the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry . The majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly ( for example " <unk> " , a true piece of utter garbage in every way ) either taking the <unk> elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians ( <unk> " <unk> " ) . More frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context ( in the various <unk> - oriented movies , the <unk> is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new - age style practice ) . Rarely , a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is <unk> in real life , but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal , or symbolic , or ... just not quite right.<br /><br />I watched this movie again after many years tonight . I had seen it before on VHS ; it is a dark , moody piece , and after watching it on DVD , I would say if you have any intention to watch this movie , watch it on DVD , do n't watch it on <unk> /><br />The darkness and moodiness are overpowering in VHS but in DVD the movie takes on a very different tone . I think Weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style , but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of VHS this goes over the edge . DVD brings the movie to life again and I saw it <unk> /><br />Anyway , seeing it as if for the first time , I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie . It 's difficult to go into all the reasons why , I do n't care to take the time to do so.<br /><br />For anybody who 's curious , anyway , if you want to see what it is like in real life , this movie is just very right on countless <unk> /><br />And for anybody who is n't , you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point .
1.0 First off , this is an excellent series , though we have sort of a James Bond effect . What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006 , it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 , Dr. No ( 1962 ) being the second , while in Golden Eye , the first film with Pierce Brosnan , Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male " M " so how could she have been in place in the beginning before Bond became a <unk> , aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older ? This is more or less a " poetic " license to thrill . We need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained . No , the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago . In the 1960 's <unk> were fantasy . ( now we call them cell phones ) and there were sliding <unk> instead of buttons . OMG , do you think 400 years from now , they would have perfected <unk> for Jean - Luc Picard ? So , please , let 's give the producers some <unk> /><br />But to try and make things a bit consistent , let us just ponder about the Cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of Battlestar Galactica . If that is the case , where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from ? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space . Well , what happened if one of the <unk> ships at war with the Caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a <unk> or whatever and one ship , loaded with human - looking Cylons , wound up not only jumping through space , but through time , back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One . They <unk> it , found out they could <unk> it and eventually destroyed themselves , but not before they themselves sent out a " <unk> " fleet to search for the legendary Caprica , only to find a <unk> but <unk> planet , which they <unk> to become the humans , who eventually invented the Cylons . Time paradox ? Of course . Which came first , the chicken or the road ? Who cares ? It 's <unk> entertaining !
1.0 Imagine turning out the lights in your remote <unk> on a cold night , and then going to bed . There 's no need to lock the doors . The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees . <unk> after midnight a car with lights off inches up the <unk> . Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.<br /><br />What makes this image so scary is the setting : a remote <unk> ... at night . Based on Truman Capote 's best - selling book , and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940 's noir films , " In Cold Blood " presents a terrifying story , especially in that first Act , as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads . It 's the stuff of nightmares . But this is no dream . The events really happened , in <unk> /><br />Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family , looking for a stash of cash that does n't exist . Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real - life events occurred , even the <unk> ... and its interior ! It makes for a memorable , and haunting , film.<br /><br />Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real - life killers . Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith , short and <unk> with a bum leg , who dreams of finding Cortez ' buried treasure . Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock , the smooth - talking con artist with an all - American <unk> /><br />After their killing spree , the duo head to Mexico . Things go awry there , so they come back to the U.S. , stealing cars , <unk> , and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place . But it 's a fool 's life , and the two outlaws soon regret their actions . The film 's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing , as the rain falls , the rope <unk> , and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart.<br /><br />Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act , " In Cold Blood " stages in riveting detail a real - life story that still hypnotizes , nearly half a century later . It 's that setting that does it . Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors <unk> ... at night ?
1.0 Lars Von Trier is never backward in trying out new techniques . Some of them are very original while others are best <unk> /><br />He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey . With so many cities lying in ruins , Leo Kessler a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration . It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.<br /><br />His uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa <unk> Line . His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers . When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the <unk> . A terrible argument ensues when a passenger 's shoes are not <unk> despite the fact they have been polished . There are many allusions to the German <unk> of adherence to such stupid details.<br /><br />The railway journey is like an allegory representing man 's <unk> through life with all its trials and tribulations . In one sequence Leo <unk> through the back <unk> to discover them filled with half - starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from Auschwitz . These images , horrible as they are , are fleeting as in a dream , each with its own terrible impact yet <unk> /><br />At a station called <unk> Leo jumps from the train with a <unk> bomb . In view of many by - <unk> he connects the bomb to the <unk> of a carriage . He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock . Later he jumps from the train ( at high speed ) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank . Looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy . <unk> as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at <unk> speed to board the train and stop the clock . If you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task . Quite ridiculous in fact . It could only happen in a dream.<br /><br />It 's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of <unk> hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the <unk> /><br />Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed , I prefer Lars Von Trier 's later films ( Breaking the Waves and The <unk> ) . The bomb scene described above really put me off . Perhaps I 'm a realist .
1.0 My name is Domino <unk> . { <unk> * dizzying * <unk> } My -- my -- my name is Domino Harvey . { CUT , <unk> } My name is Domino Harvey . { <unk> . CUT . <unk> /><br />Never have I seen a director take so much <unk> for his style before . By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott 's choppy , flashy , dizzying editing technique . If I have to choose between loving it and hating it , I 'd say I love it . It was borderline distracting at times , but the end result was pretty good and it 's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality ( even if it borrows heavily from MTV <unk> /><br />This stylistic edge <unk> itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy . Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her , no matter how much she suffered . We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke , <unk> <unk> and Edgar Ramirez . The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken 's TV production company ( what is Christopher Walken doing in every film , by the way ? ) . I guess that is a clever film technique , because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV / Reality Show editing footage as he likes . It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point.<br /><br />It <unk> then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid - fire pace , with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence . There are some funny jokes ; it 's all very modern and surreal at the same time . It 's a mess , but it 's a rather enjoyable mess . It is ultimately flawed in so many ways ( the actors try too hard to make their characters " cool " , for one ) but it works . I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie - goers who <unk> this film  but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1.0 This low - budget erotic thriller that has some good points , but a lot more bad one . The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife . Being a soft - core film , that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects . As plots go for this type of genre , not to bad . The script is okay , and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 AM watching this not to notice too many plot holes . But everything else in the film seems cheap . The lead actors are n't that bad , but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad ( one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high ) . The cinematography is badly lit , with everything looking grainy and ugly . The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying . The worst thing in this movie is the reason you 're watching it - the sex . The reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in Red <unk> Diary situations . The sex scenes are n't hot they 're sleazy , shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it . The woman also look like they are <unk> from a porn shoot . I 'm not trying to be rude or mean here , but they all have that breast <unk> and a burned out / <unk> look . Even the title , " <unk> Obsession " , sounds like a Hardcore flick . Not that I do n't have anything against porn - in fact I love it . But I want my soft - core and my hard - core separate . What ever happened to actresses like Shannon <unk> , Jacqueline <unk> , Shannon <unk> and Kim Dawson ? Women that could act and who would totally arouse you ? And what happened to B erotic thrillers like Body <unk> , <unk> and even <unk> to Kill . Sure , none of these where masterpieces , but at least they felt like movies . Plus , they were pushing the envelope , going beyond Hollywood 's relatively prude stance on sex , sexual obsessions and perversions . Now they just make hard - core films without the hard - core sex .
1.0 A series of random , seemingly insignificant <unk> at her sister 's boarding house has Miss Lemon quite <unk> . A ring , light <unk> , a <unk> , a lighter , a <unk> , a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it . Miss Lemon asks her employer , the great Belgian detective <unk> Poirot , to look into the matter . But what Poirot sees is something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined . And Poirot 's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered . It 's up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice.<br /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> is a solid , but not spectacular , entry in the long running Poirot series . I appreciate how faithful the script is to Agatha Christie 's original story . I realize that certain liberties had to be taken , but I appreciate the effort nonetheless . The major points of the mystery are all there  the petty <unk> , the boarding house , the students , the ripped <unk> , and , of course , Poirot 's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens . With a few exceptions , the cast of students is almost as I pictured them . Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout among the group . As mush as I always enjoy David <unk> 's Poirot , I get a real kick out of the episodes with Phillip Jackson 's Inspector <unk> and Pauline Moran 's Miss Lemon . This episode is a real treat as Miss Lemon gets more screen time than usual . Finally , I enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the <unk> . It 's a fun little play on the <unk> <unk> <unk> title.<br /><br />I realized while re - watching <unk> <unk> <unk> just what a tremendous influence Agatha Christie 's work was on the highly stylized Italian mystery films , or <unk> , of the 60s and 70s . Take the murder of Mrs. <unk> as an example . If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene , you would have something straight out of an early 70s Giallo . In fact , the entire plot of <unk> <unk> <unk> could have been used in a Giallo . It 's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked .
1.0 This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maugham 's short tales . The first one is The <unk> , which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable . After 17 years Albert <unk> is laid off from his church job because he ca n't read nor write . So what does he do ? <unk> a tobacco shop , of <unk> /><br />The second is Mr. Know - All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten , until I heard the familiar introduction . Another 15 minute one , and also very good . It worked better on film than in a book for me , but then perhaps that 's because I was only 14 the last time , <unk> /><br />The 3rd one is nearly a let - down . Almost an hour in length , it simply drags . It 's not all that bad , but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 . I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour , and found that it still made sense and really I had n't missed a <unk> /><br />Overall I give them 8 , 9 , and 6 out of 10 , respectively .
1.0 The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa , but it is so much more than that.<br /><br />Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things . A longing for another , one of a different race , that can not be <unk> . Even a glance is forbidden . There are no words needed . Their facial expressions say everything.<br /><br />It is the story of a black servant , Protée ( <unk> De <unk> ) and a white woman , Aimée ( <unk> <unk> ) . Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not have each other.<br /><br />The little girl , France ( Cécile <unk> ) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée . She really ca n't see this <unk> /><br />One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the <unk> . They can not even get undressed for bed by themselves . There world is about to end ; they just do n't know it yet . Their racist attitudes will be erased with their <unk> /><br />I think I would like to visit this Africa . It seems so quiet ; especially at night when you only hear the animals .
1.0 Although Lang 's version is more famous , <unk> 's work is not devoid of interest , far from it : its " celestial " sequences are even better . The metaphor of the train ( perhaps borrowed from the ending of Abel <unk> 's " la <unk> " ) is eventually more convincing than the " up above " heavenly world.<br /><br <unk> 's tenderness for his characters shows in Marie 's character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects ( the ending of " three comrades " ) .The amusement park seems to be everywhere : we see it even when we are in Marie 's poor house . I do not think that the sets are that much cheesy , they are stylized to a fault . The fair from a distance almost gives a sci - fi feel to the movie.<br /><br <unk> never forgets his social concerns : in the heavenly train going up , the Rich can not stand to be mixed up with the <unk> but as " chief <unk> " tells : " here there 's no more difference " .<br /><br />Not a major work for <unk> ( neither is Lang 's <unk> to seek out if you are interested in the great director 's career .
1.0 COME ON ! ! ! They did that on purpose ! ! Two of my current <unk> on TV ( Meloni from " Oz " and " L and O - <unk> " and <unk> from " West Wing " ) hook up for a nice little sleeper / character study . Plot 's nothing fancy , but the acting is right on the mark . Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits . Worth a look .
1.0 How can someone NOT like this movie ? ? ? This movie is so good , that the first week I saw it on the shelf at the video store it was stolen .... BEST Horror Movie <unk> .... I mean he took the Carrot and he ... well you know <unk> .. How is that NOT funny ? The only movie that comes close to touching this is Bride of Chucky and that was just great ! !
0.0 Good films can not solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top . <unk> to see it has won two awards . Extremely overrated . I first saw that kind of films from China , visually stunning BUT also with really something captivating to say , well , more than 10 years ago and I 'm sure there are still more coming up . This is not one of them , I 'm afraid .
1.0 The cast is excellent , the acting good , the plot interesting , the <unk> full of suspense ... but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long . If more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots , it would have a much better effect . Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one .
1.0 Personally , I disdain The Jerry Springer Show , however , I found " Ringmaster " to be the funniest movie I 've seen this year . The never - ending satire of Jerry Springer " guests " starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie . Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence , I definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value .
1.0 This did for crime what " Not Another Teen Movie " did for school . I laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs <unk> with each other and among themselves . An unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way . I suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30 's .
0.0 Charles Bronson stars as Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named Duke ( Juan Fernandez ) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed Crowe 's daughter ( Amy <unk> ) in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller . <unk> may not be for everyone with it 's somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining .
1.0 this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see . i was talked into it and dragged into the theater , but boy am i glad for that . i thought it was going to be just another love story , but it turns out to be <unk> much more than that . <unk> an intellectual flick , one of those movies you have to pay attention to .
1.0 Like most people , I 've seen Jason <unk> on TV and I think he 's great . But I did n't know he had a sister ! Justine <unk> is simply " <unk> as the scorned other woman . Good music , intrigue , and a death scene involving Amanda 's revenge on an abusive Dr. that will stay with you for weeks . I 'll leave it at that . Kudos .
1.0 There 's so many things to fall for in <unk> <unk> . <unk> la <unk> del <unk> ( Inside the killer 's mind ) , that it 's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning . Let 's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really , really great done . It´s made with super 8 , black and white shots , 35 <unk> , color , interviews , flashbacks . <unk> <unk> it´s like a movie made a <unk> or <unk> , which most peculiar aspect <unk> on the doubt that leaves you wondering , did he really ever existed ? The movie follows the later life of an <unk> sailor that arrived in <unk> , worked in a religious mission and then killed some people . An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced . The movie starts because some french <unk> got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death . Nowadays , some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character . The one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside <unk> mind , mainly in order to <unk> why he did what he has done . Nevertheless , the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view ; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions , we clearly never justify them . So , the first half is based upon <unk> information ; later things turn into <unk> 's childhood , giving the movie such an incredible new force ( even tough never got weak or <unk> /><br />I do n't mean -and do n't <unk> to spoil anything ; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you , believe me , the trip to see it is more than worthy .
1.0 I saw two movies over the weekend , One was " <unk> " and the other " Waqt " . Both movies are made in " Bollywood " but they are worlds apart . The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director . Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with " <unk> " , one of the best Comedy Hindi movies . His Casting of the <unk> is perfect . The story apparently taken from a <unk> Play is awesome , the treatment is superb with some exceptions . In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy ( mediocre Malik in this <unk> obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract . So even a good Director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease the <unk> and the Grandma 's who just ca nt get enough of these numbers . No Music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie . None of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the <unk> version of the <unk> - <unk> . The <unk> and role playing the Father and Son is good acting by <unk> and Akshay Kumar . His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding . A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie . Then we have a cheap <unk> tasteless Producer like <unk> Khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like " <unk> " to <unk> himself at the cost of the <unk> of Art , and they surround themselves with borderline talent , and they <unk> the investment before the word gets around . These are the Bollywood <unk> who prey on the <unk> audience to garner " Film <unk> " awards given by Bollywood <unk> 's and most of them are in the Media .
1.0 <unk> an all - star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the " Mad Mad Mad Mad World " of horror pictures , " The Sentinel " ( 1977 ) is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines . In this one , she plays a fashion model , Alison Parker , who moves into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is ( and I do n't think I 'm giving away too much at this late date ) very close to the gateway of Hell . And as a tenant in this building , she suffers far worse conditions than <unk> plumbing and the occasional water bug , to put it mildly ! Indeed , the scene in which Alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying , and should certainly send the ice water <unk> down the <unk> of most viewers . Despite many critics ' complaints regarding Raines ' acting ability , I thought she was just fine , more than ably holding her own in scenes with Ava Gardner , Burgess Meredith , Arthur Kennedy , Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach . The picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion , and although some plot points go unexplained , I was left feeling more than satisfied . As the book " DVD <unk> " puts it , " any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in <unk> ca n't be all bad " ! On a side note , yesterday I walked over to 10 Montague <unk> in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at the Sentinel House . Yes , it 's still there , and although <unk> of its heavy coat of <unk> and lacking a blind priest / nun at the top - floor window , looks much the same as it did in this picture . If this house really does sit atop the entrance to Hell , I take it that Hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens <unk> . But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time !
1.0 I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie , which is why I left it unwatched for so long , but I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car / boat chases , it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails , with nothing being overstated or over - <unk> /><br />It 's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that : less time and effort was spent on finding ever - stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die , and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching . Hell , the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise , that adds to the suspense -- who 's winning ? Who 's <unk> /><br <unk> Staden might not be as drop - dead gorgeous as Monica <unk> , but few are , and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that 's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face , her hair , and her tall , <unk> body could have been lifted straight from the comic - strip <unk> /><br <unk> Coaster - Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad - guy , in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable ( and I doubt I 'd consider taking on many brutal , psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies ) . I ca n't think of a single one of Hollywood 's " former <unk> " who could have pulled the role off that well.<br /><br />Fortunately , Blaise baddies always die , in the end ( no spoilers there ! ) That 's a really good thing , because all the girls who would have spent their time <unk> over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now <unk> settle for us ordinary <unk> .
1.0 This movie came and went in the theaters . Due to the nature of it you can see why it was n't well received . It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself . Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in America : <unk> /><br />Plot / Story : Higher Learning is mostly centered around <unk> by Omar Epps ) , a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough , and a stern <unk> by Laurence Fishburne ) . He befriends <unk> Cube ) as well as a gorgeous lady named <unk> Banks ) . Later on they end up having to deal with some <unk> on campus . <unk> by Michael Rapaport ) is confused kid who ends up <unk> some local <unk> on campus . Once they impose their views on him , he becomes as racist as they are.<br /><br <unk> : Higher Learning is not without its flaws : Character development is scarce , okay performances by Omar Epps , <unk> Banks and the leader of the <unk> name I forgot ) , <unk> Rhymes does n't fit in this movie at all . Plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché ' before this film so you know I did n't like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson . Other than that , this movie was n't half bad . Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor <unk> though I could do without the accent ) , Fudge was Ice Cube 's best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused <unk> . All in all it was one of John Singleton 's best movies and is one is one of the reasons I <unk> on the rubbish he puts out now . Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning , Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy , 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft .
1.0 Hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? This has it . I think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . But how could the romance be ditched when the story 's borrowed from something called a Harlequin Romance novel , whatever the heck that is . Had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . The mystery here was n't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of Mission Impossible international espionage . Oh well . I thought Mel Harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal ... but this Rob Stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known TV movie actor . The directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little <unk> , a little darker , more adventurous . One thing that was great about this was the use of real European locations . That could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in Canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like Budapest . Possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer 's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . Not good . Had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . This was just a tv - movie , though , so they had to add some <unk> to the picture and some of that <unk> came from the scenery . Overall , <unk> really a bad movie . I 'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best Canadian - Hungarian production I have ever seen ! ( and the only that i know of . ) I <unk> proclaim this to be a mediocre made - for - tv movie , giving it a grade of C-
1.0 In <unk> in Brazil , the <unk> Indians are friends of the <unk> and their enemies are the <unk> , friends of the <unk> . A Frenchman ( <unk> <unk> ) is captured by the <unk> , and in spite of his trial to convince them that he is French , they believe he is Portuguese . The Frenchman becomes their slave , and <unk> lives with <unk> ( Ana Maria <unk> ) . Later , he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the <unk> in a battle . In order to celebrate the victory , the Indians decide to eat him . < br /><br <unk> Era <unk> o <unk> <unk> " is another great low budget movie of the great Brazilian director <unk> Pereira <unk> Santos . The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in <unk> . The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic . The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria <unk> is magnificent , showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance . The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician <unk> <unk> . This movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans , focusing in the Portuguese and French at that time , trading with the Indians and exchanging <unk> and mirrors by our natural resources . This movie was awarded in the national festivals , such as the 1971 Brazilian Cinema Festival of <unk> ( Festival de <unk> do Cinema <unk> ) with Best Screenplay ( Nelson Pereira <unk> Santos ) , Best <unk> ( Nelson Pereira <unk> Santos and <unk> <unk> ) and Best <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ; Art Critics Association of São Paulo ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> ) , with best Revelation of the Year ( Ana Maria <unk> ) and some other prizes . My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " <unk> Era <unk> o <unk> <unk> " ( " How <unk> Was My Frenchman " )
0.0 1st watched <unk> - 4 out of 10(Dir - Mick Garris ) : Campy vampire - like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans . It 's the story of a mother and son who are <unk> shape - shifting feline - like , flesh eating , life needing , near extinct breed of humanoid ) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive . They come across as pretty normal upper - class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home , day and night . Cats are deadly to them , so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down . We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they <unk> is also a first in my movie - going experience ) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film . The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a " <unk> " and then he just wants her body . There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all - out satirical comedy on suburban life , but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he 'd just get over it and bring out the gore . Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it 's typical Stephen King downbeat ending . The movie is interesting because King 's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection , but as a worthwhile movie experience it really does n't cut it .
1.0 First off , I 'm not some Justin Timberlake <unk> obsessed with making him look good , in fact I 'm not even a huge Justin fan , but I did like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I 'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about . I did n't find Justin 's acting that bad , it was clearly the worst out of the group , but it 's a pretty impressive group , with Cary <unk> and Dylan McDermott being two names that did n't even make the first credits list . The story is basic , a journalist uncovering corrupt cops , but I found it well done . L L Cool J 's character was clearly conflicted , but I honestly did n't know what he would do in the end . Morgan Freeman is as always , the wise mentor figure he does so well , and as much as I love Kevin <unk> , he was kind of just there . <unk> character did n't have a whole lot of substance , but it 's Kevin Spacey , he can do no wrong.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop . Truly believable and really in character , he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest . Horrible <unk> , <unk> action sequences , stuff like that , but it was surprisingly well done and I did n't find any of that . Every shooting had a point , it was n't clichéd , pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall , amazing cast , decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump . I do n't know why it did n't appear in theatres , it was better than some garbage I 've seen on the big screen . I would say it 's worth seeing .
0.0 I am not so much like Love Sick as I image . Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex , <unk> , Sandu their triangle love were full of <unk> , frustration and jealous , at last , Alex <unk> up and realized that they would not have result and future . Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director Tudor <unk> was in AMC theatre on Sunday <unk> on <unk> , with us watched the movie together . After the movie he told the audiences that the <unk> to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of <unk> /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere , I do n't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie . The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki , and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I do n't like this movie are , firstly , the film did n't told us how they started to fall in love ? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living , then two girls are fall in love . It does n't make sense at all . How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man . Too much fragments , you need to image and connect those stories by your mind . Secondly , The whole film did n't have a scene of Alex and <unk> 's sexual intercourse , that 's what I was waiting for <unk> . However , it still had some parts were deserved to recommend . The " ear piercing " part was kind of interesting . Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate <unk> 's love . That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love . Also , the scene of they were lying in the soccer field , the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate .
1.0 Too many sources routinely lump this thought - provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar " <unk> " which was a mainstay in ' 70s Euro trash cinema , overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor . Perhaps coincidentally it was also director <unk> <unk> 's singular attempt at narrative film - making outside of many well - received <unk> /><br <unk> set within a historical context , <unk> charts the growing rebellion of an early <unk> century Italian nun ( Florinda Bolkan 's career performance , even <unk> her sterling work in Lucio Fulci 's devastating DON'T <unk> A <unk> ) , locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to <unk> the girl 's budding <unk> nature . <unk> why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture , she is confronted by ways in which male domination can <unk> female lives , inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi - crazed older Sister Agatha ( <unk> portrayed by veteran actress Maria <unk> from Marcel <unk> 's LES <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and - more <unk> - by a Muslim invasion . <unk> the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding , Flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be , with expected tragic results.<br /><br />With its breathtaking widescreen compositions by <unk> <unk> , who shot <unk> Antonioni 's <unk> <unk> , this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman 's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which <unk> her no rights beyond <unk> or <unk> as Sister Agatha <unk> remarks . A lengthy drug - induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on Ken Russell 's otherwise far more flamboyant <unk> notwithstanding , the movie turns out relatively <unk> in the skin department , making something of a mockery out of its semi - porn reputation . This is a serious work deserving <unk> and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation .
1.0 Before I start , I should point out that I know the editor of this film . We 've never met , but we belong to the same <unk> things which came before message boards ) , and we have talked on the phone , so I do have a bias here . Anyway ... <br /><br />Somehow , it 's ironic how while the " Rat Pack " culture of the late 50 's and early to <unk> 's made a comeback in the <unk> 's , this movie , from the son of one of the original Rat Pack , and which was made in a similar fashion , was a flop . Not only that , it was a critical flop ; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not savage <unk> gave it a mixed review , as I recall ) . And while I do n't think this is the greatest film in the world , and I am not a fan of the Rat Pack , or " cocktail , " culture , I do think this is worth seeing.<br /><br />For one thing , this looks stylish , and moves right along . For another , the core performances are all good . Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium , and has a droll edge to him . Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre - blockbuster days , like THE BIG <unk> . And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie , she does it <unk> . Admittedly , it 's not a great film ; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns , and a lot of them do n't <unk> the whole " Zen of Ben " speech ) . And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle <unk> are awful here . Still , I was entertained , and if you like gangster films , you might be too .
1.0 ... do nt read any plot <unk> because in words the plot might seem trivial , brain - dead and pointless . The film is excellent , the acting by both Denzel and Dakota ( she will go sky high , trust me on <unk> just fabulous , and the plot is mind blowing . Actually " fabulous " is a small word to use for such talented actors . The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional , a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film . If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films , you still have n't watched your favorite one yet ... Trust me , in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling . The film is awesome , see it , rent it , buy it or whatever ... just do n't miss it
0.0 The subject notwithstanding , this is an amateur , <unk> movie -- or an effort at one -- which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student 's composition book full of death " poetry " . To be sure , it will disturb viewers who are hell - bent on being disturbed , but the success will be <unk> to themselves , not to the director . To genuinely get under somebody 's skin requires sensibility , discipline , technique , and talent , as well as an eye and an ear . The film does contain one evocative image , shown as a still ( and also used on the video case ) , but with no development leading up to or away from it . If the director had had an eye , he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie -- that is , a movie .
1.0 This short film that inspired the soon - to - be full length feature - <unk> Madness - is a hilarious piece that <unk> against similar cartoons <unk> multiple writers . The short film stars Edward the <unk> who after being fired from his job , joins in the fight against the evil <unk> . This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning , but is barely present for the remainder of the feature . This film 's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd - ball comedy and a small musical number . Unfortunately not much else lies below it . The plot that is set up does n't really have time to show . But it 's surely follows it plot better than many high - budget Hollywood films . This film is worth watching at least a few times . Take it for what it is , and do n't expect a deep story .
1.0 I first saw this as a child living in East London . The scars of <unk> <unk> were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street . I remember having nightmares after seeing it . The odd thing is , it really has n't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in Cinema fiction . < br /><br />Apart from a <unk> destructive war , the scale of the machines was badly awry , more <unk> - <unk> now , but overall , an excellent and well - crafted work . It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then . I would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts . However , much was right . <unk> desire for war , mans inhumanity to man . The means of war as a catalyst for development . < br /><br / >
1.0 < br /><br <unk> Paradise " is a combination of neo - Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam 's urban cynicism . When one watches the film , they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that does n't matter , it 's attitude and atmosphere that counts . This great film has both ! ! Always trying to be different than his contemporaries , Lam gives us to traditional <unk> <unk> - <unk> and Hung <unk> - <unk> puts them in a " Raiders of the Lost Ark " setting . However , these are not the light - hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie . Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results . What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime , there is no holding back . Too bad , they do n't make films like this more often .
1.0 I heard a few friends one day saying that " Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to make another Godfather set in the early 80s . " Now , I <unk> listen to idiots / watch CNN so I decided I 'd stay away from it . Then my mate handed me the DVD and said " This is # 1 with the <unk> " , confused I tried it . This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE . It 's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford ( * <unk> * ) There is some humor though ... i.e. the <unk> and the light 80s music . Still , what s better than Al Pacino wielding an <unk> ? I give this a * * * * * out of * * * * , perfect for fans of Al or <unk> : Vice City .
1.0 Good film . <unk> a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . Or at least the feeling : that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . If you wanted to express love for someone you do n't know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? Also it 's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is <unk> down our throats . What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . Do we have to listen to the <unk> shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ?
1.0 Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action , mayhem , murder and grisly <unk> . The <unk> are a bodyguard 's search and destroy mission as his charge , young Dakota Fanning , is kidnapped from school , which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent . The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable , violent conclusion , with plot twists along the way . Washington , a former CIA operative with a drinking problem , gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot 's outline . Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning , the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends . Christopher Walken , Rachel <unk> , Radha Mitchell , Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke <unk> the good cast in support of the two stars .
0.0 Second - tier American leading man Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western  which , having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine ( though featuring a nice enough score ) . The plot offers some mild interest : the title , incidentally , refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun - runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer , cavalry agent Madison . The latter 's younger siblings are determined that the injured party , now in their charge , lead them to the gang boss responsible ; ultimately , the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both , ironically , become involved with one of Madison 's sisters ( another is raped during the raid ) . Euro - Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears <unk> as a saloon hostess , and Madison 's ex - flame .
1.0 This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations . Why ? It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch , George <unk> and Dame May Witty , as a female villain , of all people.<br /><br />When a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary , she certainly gets more than she bargained for . The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise . Seems that Witty and <unk> want to pass her off as their daughter - in - law and wife , respectively . <unk> killed his real wife and wants to do Foch in as well so that a body can be <unk> /><br />The film deals with how Foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does . Why do n't people believe her ?
1.0 Like a lot of series pilots , Dark Angel 's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet . Not that this is unusual in any way , but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more . In today 's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation , the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused , with all guns <unk> /><br />The ninety - minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together , and both episodes have a problem with focus . In the first half , we are introduced to Max and filled in on what drives her . We also get a few interesting routines with Max using her abilities to win bets , interacting with a <unk> , or sorting out co - workers ' domestic problems . The problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of <unk> , on television or <unk> /><br />It 's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus . Throughout the two <unk> , Max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time . In the second half , the repercussions catch up with him , and Max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess . This sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series , and it works , but it does n't quite click if you get my meaning . It 's like most of the pieces are there , but a couple that make a complete image have been left out . Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes , but that 's beside the point . The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty - eight less minutes.<br /><br />The last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally <unk> . Original Cindy in particular is an annoyance , and I doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes . While the acting is n't as bad as daytime soap , it is n't of such quality that I 'd commend it . Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world , but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.<br /><br />The good news is that the premise and the production values are all top - notch . In fact , this series was considered quite expensive to produce , and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that did n't last a whole season . Especially when there was ample time for both shows - they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of <unk> garbage they <unk> under the banner of reality TV . The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel , where imagination rather than <unk> , are used to draw the attention.<br /><br />In all , I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten . It never rises above the level of throwaway television , and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time . But the potential is there , and that 's often all that matters where pilots are concerned .
1.0 What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise , a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films . So ... could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated ? ? ? " Prison " is the Finnish director Harlin 's American debut , which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like " Die Hard 2 " , " Cliffhanger " and " Deep Blue Sea " . The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison , re - opened for the cause of over - population in other , more modern state <unk> . Inside the former execution <unk> , the restless spirit of the electric chair 's last victim still dwells around . The now promoted warden <unk> Sharpe ( Lane Smith ) was there already 40 years ago , when this innocent man was put to death , and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial . It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived . Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past.<br /><br <unk> " contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it 's the unbearably tense atmosphere that 'll stick to you for certain ! Unlike any other horror picture from that decade , " Prison " features an amazing sense of realism ! By this , I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls , of course , and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed ... even though these are genuinely unsettling as well . The film 's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison - drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror . The absolute best terror - moment ( providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age ) focuses on a <unk> death - struggle involving barbed wire . Haunting ! ! The screenplay only suffers one flaw , but that 's a common one ... almost inevitable , I guess : clichés ! The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding . We 've got the ugly , fat pervert with his ' cute ' boy - toy , the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old ' n wise black con who serves a lifetime ( did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman ? ) Do n't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise , as there are so many other elements to admire . The photography is dark and <unk> , the mystery is <unk> long and successfully and the supportive inmate - roles of class B - actors are excellent ( the fans will recognize Tom Everett , Tom ' Tiny ' <unk> and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder ) . Forget about Wes Craven 's god - awful attempt " <unk> " or the downright pathetic cheese - flick " the <unk> " . This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down ! Especially considering Viggo Mortensen <unk> popularity nowadays ( I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving <unk> , <unk> and other fairy creatures ... ) this true 80 's horror gem <unk> to get an urgent DVD - release !
1.0 Every once in a while the conversation will turn to " favorite movies . " I 'll mention Titanic , and at least a couple people will <unk> . I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago , these same people were moved to tears by that very movie . And they 're too embarrassed now to admit it.<br /><br />I just <unk> Titanic for the first time in a long time . <unk> to simply enjoy the story again , I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years . I cried again .... in all the same places . It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time . A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall ( yes , even more than Star Wars ) . And today , many people wo n't even admit they enjoyed it . Folks , let 's get something straight -- you do n't look cool when you <unk> this film . You look like an out of touch <unk> /><br />No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults . Some of the dialogue falls flat , and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly . However , none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.<br /><br <unk> DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful . Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation . Wait ' til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy . Kate Winslet was so strong in this film . The movie really was hers , and she held it together <unk> /><br />James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic . The sinking scenes were horrific , just as they were that night . How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me . I was utterly <unk> /><br />This film is one memorable scene after another . Titanic leaving port in <unk> . Rose and Jack at the bow , " flying " . " <unk> , right ahead ! " The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean . The screams of the doomed after she went down . And that ending that brought even the <unk> man in the theater to <unk> /><br />The music , which has also been a victim of the film 's success , was a key ingredient . James Horner 's score was simply perfect . And the love theme was beautiful and tragic . Too bad Celine <unk> 's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.<br /><br />I confess , I am a Titanic buff . As such , I <unk> the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty . Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I 've had such an interest in the ship all my life . However , I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs . I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never <unk> the tragedy . The film was made with such <unk> /><br />Another reviewer said it better than I ever could : Open up your hearts to Titanic , and you will not be disappointed .
1.0 THE <unk> THAT WOULDN'T DIE was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 . Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 ; the thing is both lurid and <unk> , but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly <unk> sort of way.<br /><br />The story , of course , concerns a doctor who is an eager <unk> in <unk> limbs -- and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab . With the aid of a few telephone <unk> , a couple of <unk> , and what looks very like a shallow <unk> pan , he brings her head back to life . But is she grateful ? Not hardly . In fact , she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing , particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.<br /><br />As it happens , the doctor is picky about this new body : he wants one built for speed , and he takes to <unk> <unk> women on city <unk> , haunting strip joints , visiting body beautiful contests , and hunting down <unk> models in search of <unk> that will raise his eyebrow . But back at the lab , the head has developed a <unk> - induced psychic link with another one of the doctor 's experiments , this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet . Can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance , wreck revenge upon the doctor , and save the woman whose body he <unk> for ? Could be ! Leading man Jason <unk> plays the <unk> doctor as if he 's been given a massive dose of Spanish fly ; Virginia Leith , the unhappy head , <unk> and <unk> in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal <unk> . <unk> babes <unk> to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you 'll need a <unk> to add up the continuity goofs . On the whole THE <unk> THAT WOULDN'T DIE comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an Ed Wood movie.<br /><br />Director Joseph Green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip , and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors , who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it . The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost , but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release , and while the film and sound quality are n't particularly great it 's just as well to recall that they probably were n't all that good to begin with.<br /><br />Now , this is one of those movies that you 'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious , depending on your point of view , so it is very hard to give a recommendation . But I 'll say this : if your tastes run to the likes of Ed Wood or Russ Meyers , you need to snap this one up and now ! Four stars for its cheesy - <unk> alone ! <unk> , Amazon Reviewer
1.0 Ah , McBain   The character name is <unk> and forever ridiculed by " The Simpsons " but it will also always  to me personally , at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90 's action flick ; directed by the cool dude who brought us " The <unk> " and starring two of the most ultimately badass B - movie heroes Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside ( the latter with a cute little macho <unk> ) . I guess " McBain " will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure , because there 's no way I can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture . The film is <unk> preposterous ( most action heroes take on a small gangster posse   McBain takes on an entire country ) and yet takes itself way too seriously . The script is a non - stop and incoherent <unk> of clichéd situations , nonsensical twists , compulsory sentimental interludes , grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings . It 's a totally delirious movie ; I loved it . < br /><br <unk> POW McBain 's life is saved by fellow soldier Roberto Santos on the very last day of the war . They each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that McBain is in Santos ' debt . <unk> years later , Santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country Columbia . Santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he 's publicly executed on El <unk> 's balcony . His sister travels to New York with the dollar note and turns to McBain for financial assistance and <unk> . McBain and his former Vietnam buddies , who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world , <unk> themselves a miserable little plane and fly to Columbia to open a gigantic can of <unk> - ass . < br /><br />Okay , let 's not fool each other here . The fact you 're reading a <unk> comment on " McBain " already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low - budget B - movie action . One of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time <unk> a list containing all the main <unk> and <unk> moments of " McBain " . This list is totally accurate and I can only concur with it . Heck , I could even add some more senseless sequences to that list ( like the preposterous and needless heroic <unk> sacrifice of a soldier who does n't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of McBain 's squad ) , but what 's the point ? You definitely know not to expect a 100 % coherent and plausible masterpiece . We know from beforehand this will be a silly and <unk> flamboyant movie , and it 's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out ! This is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former Vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt <unk> president and the national drug <unk> . Please do n't expect another " Apocalypse Now " . This particular motion picture relies on the <unk> ' n <unk> acting performances of the macho leads , a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which Joan <unk> sings a cover of " Brothers in Arms " .
1.0 Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the Horror genre . As I understand it from the commentary and things I have read , it was made during the huge Midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was underwater . <unk> were under water . cars and houses were underwater . One article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help <unk> the river after shooting each day . The fact this movie got made at all is a miracle . It is like a huge <unk> of every zombie movie ever made put through a Troma filter . It is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters . And it is fast paced and energetic and really funny.<br /><br />A toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies . The local Government covers it up , tears down the factory and builds houses over it . Some ground shifting ( ? ) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community . From there it just gets crazy and gory and fun.<br /><br />I have read these reviews on here a few times . And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer , using fake names . They use the same words and sentences . Zombie Bloodbath is cheap . It is raw . It has some bad acting . So does half the movies made . There is much much WORSE out there than this fun movie . If you hate this film so much , do n't buy it . There is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast " Trailer Trash . " And it is obvious you are not from Australia or England . It is just upsetting that this great service , the IMDb does not catch people using it just to trash others . There are bad reviews and good reviews , and I do n't mind those . I give both bad and good reviews myself . But it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie . <unk> /><br />Some of these so called " <unk> " even basically sue their " review " just to promote their own movies . One called this film Boring - well , love it or hate it , one thing you can NEVER say about this film is that it is boring . It moves fast and never has a dull <unk> /><br />Oh and this reviewer from The Netherlands ? ? ? Um - <unk> . You tried to post this same review at Amazon and it got yanked there . The SAME review only it said it was from <unk> /><br />This nonsense HAS to stop . Love it or Hate it - give it a real review or type nothing . It is obvious you have not seen the films.<br /><br />But for the record , I have and though this one is not nearly the best that I have seen , it is far from the worst . And even the worst I would give an actual <unk> and would not attack the director <unk> /><br />Hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here .
1.0 I admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film I was n't entirely sure I was going to sit through the whole thing . Like many other people , I found it pretty boring , and I was n't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite <unk> and stick them together . However , if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product , you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is . I really think it 's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists . < br /><br <unk> and <unk> is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of Andy Goldsworthy , who makes his art entirely out of things in nature , generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of <unk> . It is slow moving and <unk> , but I think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that Goldsworthy 's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated . I 've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie , rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves , which I just think is <unk> /><br />On the other hand , lots of people complain about CDs coming with the lyrics written out inside them . A lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics , I guess I 'm just the kind of person that believes that I 'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork . I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do . I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie . He does , after all , lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion , but if you do n't want Goldsworthy talk about his art while you 're watching the film , feel free to turn the sound off . That 's like not reading the lyrics if you do n't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself.<br /><br />I think that Andy Goldsworthy 's work , which I had no idea existed before I watched this movie , is incredibly impressive , and I 'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it . Indeed , since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio , photography is the only medium other than film that can express it , and I really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art , and the way that only things from nature are used . Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented , Goldsworthy 's work is moving enough to overlook that , because the film is not the star , Goldsworthy 's art is . And given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow - moving nature of the film , it seems to me that director Thomas <unk> knows that .
1.0 One of my all - time favorite so - laughably - lousy - that - it's - totally - lovable el <unk> and <unk> <unk> independent horror creature features , an enjoyably dreadful marvel that was released by the <unk> <unk> exploitation outfit Crown International Pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless drive - ins back in the 70 's and eventually wound up being rerun like crazy on several small - time secondary cable stations throughout the 80 's . I naturally first saw this gloriously ghastly abomination on late - night television one fateful Saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deep - seated , albeit completely irrational abiding fondness for it ever since.<br /><br />A meteorite falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a <unk> country lake , thereby causing a <unk> <unk> dinosaur egg to <unk> . Of course , the baby <unk> immediately grows into a gigantic <unk> , <unk> , teeth - <unk> prehistoric <unk> with goofy <unk> , an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp , <unk> , <unk> - like <unk> . Our Southern - fried male cousin to the <unk> <unk> Monster promptly starts <unk> down on various <unk> local <unk> residents of a previously quiet and sleepy hillbilly resort town . It 's up to <unk> stalwart sheriff Richard <unk> , assisted by the painfully idiotic <unk> comic relief brotherly fishing guide duo of Glenn Roberts and Mark <unk> , feisty gal pal <unk> Cobb and terminally insipid nerdy scientist Bob <unk> , to get to the bottom of things before the over - sized <unk> Jurassic throwback ruins the tourist trade by eating all the campers and fisherman that the hick <unk> makes its cash off of.<br /><br />Director / co - screenwriter William R. <unk> displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing , atmosphere , taut narrative construction and especially <unk> sound , credible acting from his hopelessly all - thumbs rank amateur community theater level cast . The performances are uniformly abysmal : <unk> is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the <unk> dopey redneck comic antics of Roberts and <unk> provoke groans of slack - jawed disbelief -- you are n't laughing with these two atrociously mugging <unk> so much as at them , particularly when the insufferable <unk> discover a severed head <unk> up and down in the murky lake water . Better yet , a clumsily integrated sub - plot concerning a vicious on - the - loose criminal leads to a spectacularly ham - fisted supermarket hold - up scene which degenerates into a hilariously stupid mini - massacre when a young lady <unk> interrupts the stick - up artist in mid - robbery ! A subsequent car chase is likewise severely <unk> as well ; it 's so <unk> staged and unimpressive that one feels more relieved than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to devour the nefarious fugitive . Moreover , David Allen 's funky <unk> - jerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic <unk> article , projecting a certain raw charisma , sneaky reptilian personality and overall forceful screen presence which makes all the horrendously underwhelming human characters seem like pathetically <unk> nobody bores in comparison . And as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our <unk> <unk> with a <unk> , the operative word for this thrilling confrontation is <unk> all the way .
1.0 At first glance , this film looks like the <unk> Sutherland series 24 for the big screen . With the focus on a plot to assassinate the President of the United States , a race against time , and plenty of Secret Service agents , the agency under the spotlight in The <unk> /><br />But wait , the protagonist turns out to be Michael Douglas ' character Pete Garrison instead , a veteran Secret Service agent famed for taking the bullet for Reagan in 1981 . The SS agents are specially trained to " take the bullet " , which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target ? But Garrison gets <unk> in the assassination plot , and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot . All this because of his failure in a <unk> test , due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady ( Kim Basinger ) . <unk> /><br />There are shades of Clint Eastwood 's In the Line of Fire . Both featured aging actors , and aging veteran has - been heroes with a bit of a historical reference , who took the bullet in their respective <unk> of duty . While Eastwood 's movie has a more enigmatic villain in John Malkovich , The Sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain , preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex - KGB villains , and the mole within the Presidential <unk> . With Douglas on the run from the law , he becomes similar to Dr. Richard <unk> of The Fugitive , hunting the proverbial one - armed man while at the same time , relying on his <unk> to <unk> fellow agents , which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick <unk> , it still boils down to the performance and <unk> of individual <unk> /><br <unk> Sutherland and Eva Longoria , top TV stars of today from 24 and Desperate Housewives , get relegated into support roles as the Secret Service investigators who are looking into Garrison 's probable involvement in the assassination plot , and at times seem to have <unk> off the pages of CSI with their forensics skills . The beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled X - Files ' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully , but alas these two had very little to do here . We know the reason why they 're in the movie , and that is to get their fans into the theatres . Also , Longoria 's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy - mama Gabrielle , and here , has her in fairly low cut <unk> ( Sutherland actually tells her to cover up ) and tight pants ( <unk> - fest for fellow <unk> /><br />Nonetheless , it 's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world , and the typical threats that they face daily , including the following up on every <unk> 's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world . It 's a decent suspense and investigative thriller , with enough subplots to keep you entertained . But one thing though , like most ending action sequences , this one has a big enough <unk> for you to fly a jumbo jet through .
1.0 Hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of Vienna . It comes from former documentary director Ulrich Seidl who adopts a very documentary - like approach to the material . However , the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as " extremes "  some are extremely lonely ; some extremely violent ; some extremely weird ; some extremely devious ; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood ; and so on . The film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time , each following the characters over a couple of days during a <unk> Viennese summer . Very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people , the many ills that plague our society in general . It is a thought - provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.<br /><br />A fussy old widower <unk> about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a <unk> for him while wearing his deceased wife 's clothes . A nightclub dancer <unk> with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy - <unk> boyfriend . A couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people . An abusive man <unk> his woman but she forgives him time and again . A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some <unk> on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent <unk> . And a mentally ill woman keeps <unk> rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car ! The lives of these disparate characters <unk> over several days during an intense summer heat <unk> /><br />The despair in the film is palpable . Many scenes are <unk> by long , awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be . Then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on - screen events leave you reeling . In particular , a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch - hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten , raped and humiliated ( thankfully all off - screen ) for some <unk> she did n't even do - <unk> a sour , almost angry taste . In another scene a man has a lit candle <unk> in his rear - end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint , all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife . While we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come - <unk> , we are simultaneously left appalled and <unk> by the nature of his punishment . Indeed , such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light - <unk> is counter - balanced with a moment of <unk> . Every shred of hope is <unk> with a sense of despair . For every character you could like or feel sympathy for , there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate . We might want to turn away from Hundstage , to dismiss it as an exercise in misery , but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded .
1.0 <unk> , I wrote that I loved " Titanic " , cried at its ending ( many times over ) , and I 'm a guy in his 60 's . I also wondered about why this great movie , which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics , was given only a 7.0 rating by <unk> <unk> /><br />Well , I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . While <unk> % of all votes gave it a 10 rating , <unk> % gave it a 1 rating . These <unk> % of these irrational imdb users , in effect , pulled the overall rating down to 7.0 . < br /><br />In my previous comments , I blamed this very unusual voting pattern ( a sudden surge in 1 ratings , with a high 10 rating , dropping only gradually and then suddenly <unk> course and jumping at the 1 rating level ) on only one thing : hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio . Believe me , I 've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people ( young men , mostly ) , who <unk> him left and right . They absolutely hate the man , and they will have no part in giving him any credit in " Titanic " . ( To answer one other user : I am NOT talking about someone who just really does n't like the movie that much , and gave it a 5 or a 6 , etc . Everyone has , and is entitled to , his / her own taste . But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for " Titanic " , pulled to that level by an <unk> number of ridiculous 1 ratings , is a fair reflection of the overall motion <unk> /><br />Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of " Titanic " to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical " bombs " ( there are many more , but these 5 will prove my point ) . " Heaven 's Gate " ( 1980 ) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing , and imdb voters ' ratings were : <unk> % 10 ratings and <unk> % 1 ratings ( overall rating of <unk> ) . " Big Top Pee - wee " ( 1988 ) got <unk> % 10 ratings and <unk> % 1 ratings ( overall rating of <unk> ) . " Cat People " ( 1982 ) got <unk> % 10 ratings and <unk> % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 5.8 ) . " Blind Date " ( 1987 ) got <unk> % 10 ratings and <unk> % 1 ratings ( overall rating of <unk> ) . " <unk> ' Jack Flash " ( 1986 ) got <unk> % 10 ratings and <unk> % 1 ratings ( overall rating of <unk> ) . WHAT DO ALL OF <unk> FILMS HAVE IN <unk> WITH " <unk> " ? ALL OF THE <unk> OF THEIR 1 <unk> ARE <unk> ! ! ! ! THAN " <unk> " , AND NONE OF <unk> <unk> EVER WAS <unk> FOR A <unk> <unk> . Again , " Titanic " got <unk> % 1 ratings ! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just <unk> /><br />Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo <unk> /><br / >
1.0 Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it 's making . Firstly , it is a sequel to Fulci 's hit Zombi 2 , with Zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero 's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi . Confusing enough ? Basically , none of the films have anything to do with one another , but who cares when they make money . I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to walk out . Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to <unk> the running time.<br /><br <unk> 3 's plot is your typical zombie fare . Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines , terrorists steal it <unk> a plague , and zombie run amok . The scientists want to create an antidote , while the military is set on <unk> down everyone without prejudice . There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet . < br /><br />Overall , I actually liked this film . I heard horrible things , but I find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable . The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution , corrupted military , Man playing God , etc . I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film , but it <unk> off in a weird direction , presumably when Mattei came on <unk> /><br />Besides ripping off other zombie flicks , this was very reminiscent of Romero 's The <unk> . You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with , " When you see the men in white suits & gas masks , Run to them for Help . " This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies . Later , they straight up steal a scene from <unk> in which one of the regular , <unk> people is killed by mistake.<br /><br />The gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner . How is it cool ? Let me count the ways  1 . Zombie Birth 2 . Flying Zombie Head 3 . Zombie Birds . 4 . Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool . My favorite zombie was the machete - wielding maniac at the gas station . He was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.<br /><br <unk> <unk>  When a sergeant insists on <unk> a zombie , the scientists asks , " Do n't you think that once the <unk> is in the air , it will fall to the ground , and <unk> everything ? " To which the <unk> boldly replies , " Now you 're talking science fiction . " He also continues to mention the " Science Fiction " told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.<br /><br <unk> : Gallery , Trailers , and <unk> , most notably the one with Mattei where he insists he directed 40 % of the scenes , yet can not recall which ones or any other significant details.<br /><br />Bottom Line : A must see for zombie and Fulci fans.<br /><br />Rating : <unk> /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> / <unk>
1.0 A neat ' race against time ' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have <unk> plague , so while the health authority and <unk> battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts , the murderers think the heat is because the victim 's infected cousin is holding out on them . < br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it 's well worth downloading . A lot ( all ? ) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations , which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail , though to me it does look under - exposed , even for noir - maybe mobile lighting <unk> then were n't what they are . There is also a plenty of location background noise , which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene , anyone ? There are a lot of non - professional supporting artists in crowd scenes , and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly <unk> to begin with - not much chance for <unk> or <unk> , though the final chase is worth hanging on for . There 's not much wrong with the lead actors either : Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic , intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific , while Widmark , as he often did , <unk> the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time . < br /><br <unk> should remake this - no <unk> , no mysticism , no special FX , just a good yarn full of character conflict , and a topical theme . Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole , and that 's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types <unk> this dark , sleazy , against - the - clock drama . There 's even a midget newspaper <unk> /><br <unk> ? What community ? <unk> think you 're living in the Middle Ages ? "
1.0 In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath . A famous <unk> <unk> named <unk> <unk> Mitchum ) comes hired by the citizens to rid the <unk> ( Leo <unk> , Claude Atkins , among others ) , <unk> 's hoodlums . There he meets the <unk> ( Emile Meyer ) , his daughter ( Karen Sharpe ) , her <unk> <unk> ) , the <unk> <unk> ) and the <unk> owner ( Ted De <unk> ) . Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some <unk> saying the following : <unk> Warning , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned . Check all hardware at the marshal 's office <unk> Clint finds his ex - girlfriend , a local <unk> ( Jan Sterling ) in charge of the <unk> girls ( Angie Dickinson , Barbara Lawrence , among them ) . But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint . At the end the <unk> <unk> appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands.<br /><br />This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff - for - hire who had only one more killing to go . It begins as a slow - moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot . The tale is almost grim , a <unk> comes to a town just in time to make sure its <unk> but later the events get worse . The highlights are the burning at <unk> and the climatic showdown at the ending . <unk> and great role for Robert Mitchum as <unk> angel and bitter gunfighter , he 's the whole show . <unk> and lively musical score by Alex North ( Spartacus , <unk> ) , <unk> cinematography in black and white by Lee <unk> . The motion picture is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson ( Al <unk> , Three in <unk> ) who made good Western as <unk> to a gunfighter and <unk> <unk> episodes . Watchable results for this offbeat Western .
0.0 I confess -- Emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately , this is at best a <unk> /><br <unk> to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here -- Kate <unk> ( having previously played Flora <unk> in Cold <unk> Farm , clearly Emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful Emma . Raymond <unk> makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill . The production is handsome , but the interiors are far too <unk> /><br />However , there are several major problems . The first is Mark Strong -- first of all , he does n't look right for Mr. Knightley . This is perhaps because he plays the role like a <unk> Victorian <unk> . It 's badly out of <unk> /><br />The second problem is one of length . Simply put , the film is much too short -- to get the right kind of feel , it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . Austen is an <unk> 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . It only needs to be <unk> down and arranged properly . Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise . First , this is a rather gloomy film , and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy . More significantly , Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of <unk> feast . What planet , or minor work of Thomas Hardy , is this come from ? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel . And I believe that it is hugely <unk> to try to make improvements upon -- <unk> /><br />Watch the Paltrow version , or watch Kate in Cold <unk> Farm .
1.0 Gabe Ryan ( Frankie Thomas ) gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums . His sister ( Ann Sheridan ) does her best to keep him out of trouble , but it just seems to follow him . Aside from his associations with the <unk> gang , Gabe is followed by real - life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance . They need someone to blame for the <unk> , and Gabe is it . It is up to the <unk> to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just <unk> /><br />The the scene that introduces the Dead End Kids is really quite good . The boys wander on over to the new resident 's furniture on the street , and proceed to make it their own . They talk to each other in <unk> posh accents and talk about drinking tea together ; Bernard <unk> takes a nap in a chair . The boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy , but after he proves himself a good fighter , they ask him to join their <unk> /><br />The <unk> scene is rather good too , filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first , but is really rather clever and <unk> /><br />Later , when Billy <unk> studies to become the boy mayor , he has a dream about <unk> . This is wonderfully staged , with tiny <unk> of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him.<br /><br <unk> <unk> Their Faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of Angels With Dirty Faces , and really tells what the kids are doing . Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set , these boys make nice in this film . But rather than seem disingenuous , it makes for some great laughs . This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in The <unk> Boys series . We even get a few garbled words from Leo <unk> .
1.0 I have n't read through all the comments , but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be <unk> . I 'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just did n't make much sense to me even when I <unk> them . 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also . " Poor Little Rich Girl " which was Tourneur 's next film is 65 minutes long and " Pride of the Clan " which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long . So I 'm relieved to see that I was n't crazy , there must be part of this film missing and that 's why the resolution did n't make much sense.<br /><br />It 's hard to review or comment on a movie that you 're only able to see half of ... but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the <unk> of an East Coast movie studio of the time . It 's the earliest film I 've personally seen that 's based on the movie industry itself . The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick , who was later a mainstay Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges ' films . He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart , who Warwick does resemble somewhat . After the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl ( Doris Kenyon ) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly . After that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now.<br /><br />Again , I 'd recommend it to anyone who 's interested in film history for the documentary value , but in the form we have it does n't hold up much as a movie and is n't a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur 's work .
1.0 I was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time I even thought going to bed , something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my <unk> /><br />This movie could have been another easy slam <unk> anti - gun film , but instead they chose to examine the <unk> of the shootings . And even better , the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out , a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie . This film not only does n't follow the formula , it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards.<br /><br />I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti - <unk> drugs more - the kids from <unk> who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way Deanna popped them every time the nightmares started . Up until recently they were <unk> the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have . It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film , having a relative who suffers from a mental illness , I can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses . Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues . And for those who think certain things could n't happen in a hospital ( I do n't want to tell any <unk> ) , you 're dead wrong on that too - I 've been there . The script was so real it was amazing.<br /><br />Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it 's too late . <unk> they 'll thank you for it .
0.0 The <unk> for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning , then immediately start raving about the animation . I should have known what that <unk> /><br />The main character , Palme , is a good example of the whole movie 's problem . One minute , Palme is a humble hero in search of himself , the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of.<br /><br />Like all of the characters in the movie , Palme is poorly defined . You do not bond with the characters at all , although <unk> has acquired a couple of fan girls . It seems that the writer was more interested in <unk> all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters ' motivations and <unk> /><br <unk> , useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie . The writer seriously needed to <unk> his story . Perhaps he was trying to be epic , but it was simply too much information for a two - hour movie . However I ca n't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a TV series or graphic <unk> /><br />In the last five minutes of the movie , I simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters , the relationships , and the whole plot was . I touched my companion and he started cracking up too , as did a young man seated behind us . We tried so hard to control ourselves , but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.<br /><br />On the bright side , the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs . The animation almost guides you ; when you do n't care about the characters , it tells you how to feel .
1.0 HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror films of the past decade . The sub - plot is original and the main plot is even better . The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror film . Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.<br /><br <unk> Rains shocked the world with THE <unk> MAN in 1933 , well now , Kevin Bacon has shocked * us * with HOLLOW MAN . One of the most thrilling horror films ever . The action is intense and the chills are true . You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night . The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue , Josh Brolin , Kim Dickens , Joey <unk> , Greg <unk> , and Mary <unk> . All of whom do an exceptional job . < br /><br <unk> /><br />Dr . Sebastian Caine ( Kevin Bacon ) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible . After animal <unk> , they move on to human testing . But someone has to be the subject . <unk> , Caine is turned invisible . But when his team is unable to bring back into <unk> , Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge ... <unk> <unk> /><br />The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century . <unk> the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2 , this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go . The first 45 minutes or so are slow , developing the characters and showing how their experiments work . The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans . Think of <unk> BLUE SEA . Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man . And then change the water into fire and explosions . A rehashing of a killer shark movie . Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets <unk> .
1.0 Due to the invention of a " The <unk> <unk> " , flesh - eating zombies are brought under control , and become productive members of society ; however , they perform <unk> tasks .

1.0 Then you must see this film , to understand the reality . Having read the book , Ms. Duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with <unk> disorder ; formerly labeled manic - <unk> /><br />It is hard to believe that in this day and age , people still critique others with emotional problems , or those who seek psychiatric help . <unk> and <unk> thinking still exists , and this is <unk> /><br />In this film , the audience sees the pain and suffering Ms. Duke had been through , especially as a child . Many of us may remember her from the teenage " Patty Duke Show " . She was a household name in America by age <unk> /><br />You learn of her exploitation by the <unk> played by Howard Hesseman ) . As she was growing up in the 1950 's , the <unk> was in full - force . However , we see as she advances in her career , yet the illness becomes worse . She goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity ; even marries someone whom she <unk> the next week ; and she has several conflicts and <unk> with her children and elderly mother . All these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy , and <unk> /><br />A recent survey released by <unk> ( National Alliance on <unk> <unk> ) recorded that a majority of US adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of <unk> disorder . It also was released that one in five <unk> to the <unk> believed that people could <unk> their illness without medication if they wanted to . ( <unk> Magazine , Winter 2006 ) If you watch this film , you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not " pull herself up by her <unk> " and " get well " until she was educated about her disorder , and received proper treatment . Thank you , Ms. Duke , for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice .
1.0 In the periphery of São Paulo , the very low middle - class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and the teenager <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) have deep secrets . The religious <unk> is indeed a hit - man , hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . He has a lover , the very devout woman <unk> ( Martha <unk> ) , and he wants to <unk> , going to the country with her . <unk> has a young lover , <unk> ( Ismael de <unk> ) , who delivers <unk> for his father 's butcher shop . <unk> is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery , having active sexual life , smoking grass and loving heavy metal . When <unk> is killed and <unk> in their neighborhood , the lives of the members of the family change.<br /><br <unk> Todos " is a great low budget Brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big Brazilian city . The story is very real , uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big Brazilian cities ( drug dealers , hit men , fanatic religious <unk> people , hopeless teenagers etc . ) , has many plot points and a surprising end , and the characters have excellent performances , acting very natural and making the story totally believable . The camera follows the characters , giving a great dynamics to the film . In the Extras of the DVD , the director Roberto <unk> explains that his screenplay had no lines , only the description of the situations , and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings . The actors have <unk> in <unk> and they used lots of <unk> , being the reason for such natural acting . My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Contra Todos " ( " Against Everybody " )
1.0 as a habit i always like to read through the ' hated it ' reviews of any given movie . especially one that i 'd want to comment on . and it 's not so much a point - counterpoint sorta deal ; i just like to see what people say on the <unk> /><br />however , i do want to address one thing . many people that hated it called it , to paraphrase , ' beautiful , but shallow , ' some even going so far as to say that norm 's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot , at best.<br /><br <unk> like to <unk> /><br />as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction , i can relate . daily , you see them abuse themselves , knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self - destruction . and it 's not about the specifics of what they did when ; how or why <unk> decided to take up gambling and <unk> with questionable folks ; it 's really more how they are wired . on one hand , they are veritable geniuses , and on the other , painfully self - destructive ( it 's a lot like people like <unk> <unk>  the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart ) and all the while you see this , you know this , and what 's worse , you realize you ca n't do a damn thing about it.<br /><br />for <unk> <unk> , a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur , and who was to blame . in the end , no one is , and often , there is no why . but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization . sometimes it takes a lifetime . and sometimes it never comes at all .
0.0 The films of <unk> are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light - years behind that of Looney <unk> , Disney and MGM at their prime . Sadly , due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame - rates and lovely backgrounds , the <unk> style ( which debuted about 1950 ) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s . After all , the films were dirt cheap to make and they 'd received several Oscars to " prove " that the cartoons were now mainstream . So as a result , lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend was n't reversed until the <unk> /><br />This <unk> film is one of the early ones . The characters are very simply drawn ( any simpler and they would have used stick figures ) and the backgrounds were ugly -- simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap - dash manner ( often with a <unk> and rarely completely filling the <unk> /><br />As for the story , it 's a <unk> story with a strong jazz style attitude . Some will love this , others will just find it very , very loud . It 's the traditional " Frankie and Johnny " story and because of the shootings and all , it 's probably not a great film for the kids . Heck , because of the animation and jazz , it 's not a particularly good film for me , either ! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank ( which I am , to a degree ) . However , I love animated films and a little of this <unk> <unk> style goes a very , very long way and you ca n't seriously consider them great works of art -- just very , very quickly made cartoons . Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something -- anything else !
0.0 Shame really - very rarely do I watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end . I 've seen quite a few of Ira Levin 's adaptations - ' Rosemary 's Baby ' and ' The Stepford Wives ' - and liked both them , but this just did n't appeal to me.<br /><br />When I read the plot outline - an award winning playwright ( Michael Caine ) decides to murder one of his former pupils ( Christopher Reeve ) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited . I like thrillers , Michael Caine 's a good actor , Sidney Lumet 's a good director and Ira Levin 's work is generally good.<br /><br />I wo n't spoil it for anyone who has n't seen it yet , but all I 'd say is there are <unk> of twists and turns . So many its kind of hard to explain the film 's plot line in detail , without giving it away . I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes , before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out . Though I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out <unk> /><br />The main cast - Michael Caine , Christopher Reeve , Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles . Though Worth 's obvious fake Russian accent got on my nerves slightly ( nothing personal Irene , I think any actor 's fake accent would irritate me ) . Not sure if Cannon 's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone reading this - I do n't want you to be put - off watching this because of my views - give it a chance , you may like it , you may not . It 's all about opinion .
1.0 <unk> , if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some <unk> - old comics - adapted movie rated <unk> , will you call me crazy ? That 's just to catch your attention . Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . It 's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . Dick Tracy is one of those ca n't be easily outdated , in terms of <unk> /><br />The negative reviews mainly complained about <unk> 's " messed up " story . But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and I had no problem following it . I did n't see the comic books , yet I am not a huge US comic fan , but I appreciate the top - notch film - making and performances . Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . But , if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together , what would you expect . I had some scratches on my head , and ca n't help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? The title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . Madonna was more express - less than " breathless " in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . Apparently he 's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . We can see a hybrid of Scarface , Michael Corleone , Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our <unk> to make us laugh . And many thanks to make - <unk> /><br />To me it 's not bad at all . The surreal feeling really got me .
1.0 Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum , always a hoodlum , and nobody gets in or out of ` The Life ' for free . <unk> hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run <unk> because they ca n't make it in the legitimate world , maybe because they have a criminal record , or a drug habit , or because they 're just lazy . This simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other . The film is written , produced , and directed by Laurence Fishburne , who also stars as <unk> Mike ( all hoodlums have <unk> ) , and is based on his play , ` Riff <unk> . ' It feels like a play from beginning to end , especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted . Often times the dialog comes very fast , much faster than it would on stage , and I think it 's the film 's biggest flaw . Mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street , a sort of <unk> <unk> rap , that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses . The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men , these hoodlums who murder , cheat , and betray each other , as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt . The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live , but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all . One is too stupid , another a junkie , and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders , or even laughs , at the irony of <unk> demanding from him hanging in the <unk> to tell jokes in the midst of his demise .
1.0 I 'm glad that this is available on DVD now . This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty - headed flashing lights & constant loud <unk> /><br />Essentially , if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you wo n't like this film . The reasons for this are quite simple , but unfortunately rarely achieved : Matthew <unk> has done a fantastic job of <unk> the story of Catherine <unk> 's novel ' Marianne Dreams ' successfully to a screenplay . An <unk> task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.<br /><br />The casting is excellent , allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now ; they indulge in the craft of acting ! I know , I know , actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging <unk> at the camera lens <unk> a <unk> of car chases , explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat , but it does actually happen in this film.<br /><br />This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative <unk> & not the spoon - fed tabloid reader - Apart from a solid script , direction & acting , it relies on atmosphere , suspense & implied horror . If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of ' Paper House ' is more in the vein of <unk> than Tobe <unk> /><br />In conclusion then , if you like lots of loud noises , explosions , constant cuts , & bright flashing colours you 'd be better off watching ' Transformers ' , but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful & evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you <unk> nonsense then this might just be your thing .
1.0 A small funny film . It is totally incredible , unbelievable , impossible . But it is funny how an <unk> masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized , even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his <unk> . Of course it is a <unk> of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet . You must not believe ten percent of what you 're told there and never , ever , ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally . Most of their " businesses " there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you . But here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive , he is absurdly silly . But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his <unk> and winning . One think is sure too . Security in English <unk> is not exactly what it should be , but I guess it 's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and <unk> it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them <unk> . Then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage , a real plague on modern <unk> , and do n't expect to get fair compensation . Or even <unk> a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous . I can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener . Funny , is n't it ? Dr Jacques <unk> , University Paris <unk> , University Paris 1 <unk> Sorbonne & University <unk> Saint Quentin en <unk>
1.0 Most of the feedback I 've heard concerning <unk> Machine has been pretty mixed . A couple even saying that they think " it sucked " . Well , to those people I say , get some <unk> imagination and go <unk> yourself . This was a very entertaining flick.<br /><br />The story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these <unk> - costume looking , <unk> called <unk> . Eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you , which then is able to control your actions due to hot - <unk> your nervous system . Unfortunately for two love - seeking lonely young adults , they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug , and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered . Is there a way to stop the transformation ? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat ? Why do the <unk> fight one another ? Do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty ? Only one way to find out.<br /><br />Going into <unk> Machine I was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions , but it turned out being a great surprise . A few unanswered questions , some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of . From the anime feel to it , to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel , this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses . With a ever - developing story that 's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make - up effects and blood splatter , this is one flick fans of <unk> / horror / <unk> / splatter fans should check out . 8 outta 10
1.0 I probably <unk> my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret <unk> ( 2001 ) . Now I know about four times as much ( I doubt I learned a whole heck of a lot from Not Without My Daughter ( <unk> /><br <unk> is a splendid budget Iranian comedy about a group a girls ( working individually ) to attend a <unk> soccer match for their country 's place in the World Cup . Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches , so the nation 's armed forces have been <unk> to save any women who try to enter from themselves . Some ( teen ? ) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys , but are caught . The movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are <unk> by soldiers , awaiting some <unk> punishment ( although , the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one <unk> away from being <unk> /><br />The movie explores the absurdity of the situation . The thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the <unk> <unk> philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago . This farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom , so a soldier <unk> her demands that she cover her eyes so she ca n't see the graffiti . The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes : at one point some friction arises between a <unk> who is rural and the girls who are <unk> /><br />Fortunately , this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the Great Satan . You have to be in the mood for it , but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they wo n't get it .
0.0 I have to agree with most everyone 's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written . The acting was not much more above the lower production values however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it . In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and <unk> well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer . I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit " Dead Like Me " where she plays the role of Daisy <unk> and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner . I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader . I felt as though if anyone might " make it " from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure . If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the ' Godfather ' or perhaps ' <unk> ' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low - budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying " It 's a start ! "
1.0 Well let me just say something about these actors , they really were a good decision , and from experience , having actors really brings the dialogue to life . If you walk into this even fifteen minutes late , you 'll be in for a shock , the movie will have already began . You do n't want to miss the first few jokes , assuming you came to not miss any jokes.<br /><br />Wow ! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending . Not to be harsh , I mean I loved it , but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped ! But i 'm getting ahead of myself , lets start with the very start of it , when it began . The plot outline goes like this , there is this man , and not to give away any spoilers , ( * Spoiler Alert ! ! * ) ( he has n't had any sex ever ( ! ) they use this plot device to set the story moving , and there are ( intentionally or not , it could go either way ) some funny situations had by the main characters , some containing irony , and jokes , and awkward situations , you know.<br /><br />The director uses the <unk> in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog , some music , and jokes to make a funny movie , designed as a comedy , where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between . I went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it , and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy . TEN STARS ! ! !
0.0 <unk> <unk> ( 1983 ) * * / * * * * * 86 minutes Director Jim <unk> Cast Bo Hopkins , Susan <unk> , <unk> Shirley , Patrick <unk> , Dana <unk> < br /><br <unk> year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it is n't long before folks around her start dying off . The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th <unk> Dana <unk> . The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk . These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa 's <unk> birthday <unk> /><br />This below average slasher is n't too memorable . It has a made for TV feel , without much score besides the title character 's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout . Lines like " the killer will turn us into <unk> . " <unk> into standard eighties slasher screenplays . <unk> calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship . Apparently <unk> sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make - up . This movie would be hard - pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close - ups of her . The social commentary on Indians was n't developed enough to be taken seriously . I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets . Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt 's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver . But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow .
1.0 This may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially <unk> world of the American college experience of the late 60s - early 70s . Go ahead , name another movie that even approaches this one : " Getting Straight " ? " <unk> " ? These are caricatures . " Return of the <unk> Seven " has its moments , but that 's a retrospective film about ( self - obsessed ) individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted * in * that time and place . " Drive , He Said " <unk> with subtlety and nuance where it should , and a swift kick in the shorts where that 's the only appropriate <unk> the anti - draft movement , the ambiguity of big - time college sports ( especially when there 's a war on ) , the sexual revolution of the period , and the general <unk> of the day . Believe me , it was like that.<br /><br />The whole cast deserves <unk> ( as does the director , of course ) but particular praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern , as the basketball coach , and Karen Black , the hero 's very <unk> except for that <unk> love interest . William <unk> , as the lead , also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student - athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film ( remember Anthony Perkins in " Tall Story " ? <unk> /><br />All in all , a classic of a <unk> and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on ( " boring " , " <unk> um , right , <unk> , please go back to your Arnold movies ) . Why is n't this film available from imdb ?
1.0 First saw this movie in about 1990 , and absolutely died laughing through it . It became a cult favorite with my circle of friends , and we 'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ( " I 'm going home in a bag ! " ) . Needless to say , the humor is still there , 15 years later . It 's become a tradition at Halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film ( good thing you can still buy it off Ebay ! ) I 've found that Halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek .. and this movie provides it <unk> pathos , suspense , <unk> love , nobility and the list goes on . Royal <unk> provides an amazing heartfelt performance as Old Man <unk> . I remember seeing him in " The 7 Faces of Dr. <unk> " as a bad guy who met a bad end . Here , you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning . < br /><br />If you are n't careful , you 'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie . The creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments , little subtle costume digs at other sci - fi movies , and even a scene ripped from the pages of <unk> E. <unk> /><br />Don't spend too much thought <unk> trying to analyze a movie , <unk> this is fun fare without the need for <unk> , and should n't be offensive to anyone ( well , maybe stupid people , but they wo n't know they 're being mocked .. ).<br /><br <unk> if you 'll excuse me , I 'm gon na go get a ' <unk> - nut ' bar .... <br /><br <unk> " <unk> " <unk> , karaoke DJ / entertainer
1.0 The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon , who I 've had a crush on since 9th grade , which was his first year on SNL . I am a die - hard Yankees fan , and I did n't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes , when they begin showing clips of the <unk> games . I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I would n't have to hear that which must not be heard , but otherwise it was completely <unk> /><br />I thought Jimmy played the role very well , because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky , and he is a nervous and quirky guy . I know that it may not be a Academy Award - winning stretch , but the movie is just a light , fun , romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.<br /><br />Jimmy and Drew worked well together , and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past . ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie ? What ? ) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him , and thank goodness , because Taxi could have killed it . I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot . Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . I imagine it must be difficult , and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time ( Tom Hanks , Russell Crowe , etc ) you 'll see that they started off in some flops . <unk> Buddies ? Australian soap operas ? Here 's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen . I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do ?
1.0 There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times . <unk> <unk> or <unk> information in the realm of <unk> , have kept <unk> , <unk> and <unk> busy with enough work to last them decades . Occasionally , some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their <unk> or even of their existence . That is the premise of the film entitled " The Night <unk> . " It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon ( Robin Williams ) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles . Perhaps its because his show is losing it 's authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself . Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess ( Bobby Cannavale ) and his and best friend ( Joe Morton ) , he seeks shelter in his <unk> despair and isolation . It is here , a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help . Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter ( Rory Culkin ) . In reading the boy 's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents , Noon is captivated and wants to help . However , things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself en - wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare . This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. <unk> , Sandra Oh as Anna and John <unk> as pop , this might be comical . Instead , this may prove to be one of William 's more serious performances . * * *
0.0 This is not a good movie . It 's disjointed , all the acting is bad , and has a lame story you 've seen a thousand times done much better else where . Not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away . Worst of all , no one bothered to tell <unk> <unk> she ca n't sing . But who cares , she 's sooooo damn good looking . But I digress , nothing new here . Bottom - line , hot girl group gets taken advantage of , some one gets hooked on drugs , someone gets hooked on a guy , some one gets the hell out , and then the horrible stuff happens . Surprise , surprise . Welcome to the music business . I ca n't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie . So many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to <unk> Black Movies . I do n't play that ! If you want to support these films by going to see them - great ! If you enjoyed it - super ! To each his own . But do n't try to tell me it was good . <unk> ! I wish colored folks would not <unk> over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors . Wanna see a good African - American movie ? See Love Jones . Ray . Or The Color Purple . Those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin . Why ? Because they told compelling stories with great acting , that made you feel something long after you left the theater . Just because it 's our experience does not automatically make it a good film . It 's only good -- when it 's good . Period .
0.0 " The Deadly Look of Love " is essentially " Fatal Attraction " with a couple of twists added onto the back half . The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three Movies of the Week . It is yet another cautionary tale about <unk> to temptation , and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.<br /><br <unk> ( Vincent Spano ) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund . Even though he has it all , he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with Janet ( Jordan Ladd ) . Janet , a doe - eyed blonde from <unk> Falls , falls hard for Brett , and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement . Shortly after the wedding , Mrs. Brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large , luxurious home she shared with her new husband . When the police question Brett , he promptly points the finger at Janet . Following her arrest , Janet seems to get <unk> by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before . Her defense attorney ( Holland Taylor ) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it.<br /><br />Did she do it or did n't she ? How will it end ? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time " The Deadly Look of Love " airs on your local station . And be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story : men are pigs , and women are crazy .
1.0 The movie is absolutely silly.<br /><br />But were you expecting a high - brow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk ? Really ? Jay Chou 's acting is n't exactly the most moving thing I 've ever seen , but I certainly enjoyed the movie . Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce ? No , not really . Was it thoroughly entertaining if you 're just taking it at surface value ? Absolutely . It 's a movie about some Chinese eye - candy <unk> and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise . There 's an evil Triad - style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this . A love interest . It 's formulaic but really , suspend disbelief for a while . Come on . It 's called Kung Fu Dunk . What do you really think you signed on for ? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some <unk> subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise , but we got a great laugh out of it . They would appear to be extremely <unk> on Jerusalem and the numbers 1 , 10.<br /><br />I laughed , I cried , I hurled . I 'd watch it again.<br /><br <unk> for that fight scene in the bar . Well choreographed and well shot . I especially enjoy the <unk> lit pool table - I 'd LOVE to play on one of <unk> /><br <unk> enough for me , but I dig on trash cinema .
1.0 An old saying goes " If you think you have problems , visit a hospital . " That has been updated in recent years to " If you think you have problems , watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer 's ! " This movie is one of those that is so bad , it 's good ! That 's why I gave it a seven - it 's all right , but not great . It 's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as " an hour of your life you 'll never get back ! " All the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing Jerry , etc . The shocker was watching Molly Hagan , who normally plays sweet characters ( " Seinfeld " and " Herman 's Head " ) playing a trailer - trash mom and Jaime <unk> ( " My Name Is Earl " ) as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . The men ( including the staff producer ) were presented as quintessential <unk> who deserved what they got . I do n't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . Here in Phoenix , it 's shown back - to - back for two hours every morning and , after that , everything else seems to pale . Again , I give this movie a seven ... it 's good but not great . Jerry Springer is best taken in small one hour doses .
1.0 There are a few spoilers in this <unk> /><br <unk> to the comments I just read by <unk> and a few others , I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series.<br /><br />I am a Judson Mills fan but also a huge Chuck Norris fan and while I 'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little , the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being <unk> /><br />The opening fifteen minutes with <unk> running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed . I do fail to see how that many " professionals " were n't able to hit a moving target , but the action was definitely there and <unk> , being the hero , had to survive.<br /><br />As for the comment about needing to " get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the <unk> . " This movie was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January airing and filming was completed in May of 2001 , a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the <unk> /><br />If the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it , maybe they would have realized the plot of the story : <unk> , a Bin Laden like character , planned to set off a nuclear device in the United States . The President 's Man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem.<br /><br />Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on it.<br /><br / >
0.0 I did n't like this film at all ! First of all , I do n't know why , but everyone here says , that <unk> <unk> 's play is excellent , which in my opinion is absolutely wrong ! She is not like Natasha : another appearance , another character ... What 's worse , she is a very <unk> actress and that 's why she was n't able to play this role ! She disfigured the heroine completely ! That was really disgusting to watch her play ! To my mind , that would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress , because that would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person . Unfortunately , <unk> looked like a drunk man , who has n't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye ... ( Thank 's God , in this film there 're some actors , whose play was awesome ! I suppose , that <unk> <unk> <unk> with his task very well ! I was pleasantly amazed ! He is one of the few people who 's read the book , which is very important for the play . In addition , I liked plays of our Russian actors , that was really wonderful to watch them ) ) The only thing I liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses ! My advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense , the aim , with which Leo <unk> wrote this masterpiece , and maybe realize the whole idea of the book ... 1 from 10
1.0 No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that . Here 's a few different <unk> on it from one of those " religious nuts , " as one bigoted reviewer puts it so <unk> . < br /><br />1 ) " Baby Face " ( 1933 ) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex . There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film : look cute , bat your <unk> , offer your body for free ..... and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you <unk> /><br />In this case , it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money ..... lots of it . At least four men in this film do provide just that , even if it ruins their lives in the process . < br /><br />2 ) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message : all the money and material goods in the world wo n't make a person feel fulfilled . A sad comment that so many " critics " here would rather have immoral messages , preferring sleaze over substance . No surprise , I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it , the movie is entertaining start - to - finish and Stanwyck has some great lines , particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers . At a little over 70 minutes , this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it .
0.0 This film has the <unk> of a really good story . The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard , especially in the North Pacific , is the stuff of heroes and legends . This film <unk> up a good story with three endings ( none satisfying ) , a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged " romantic " relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire . The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing . Costner is good - especially his hand acting ( watch for it ) . Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible . The main female characters are one dimensional . The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she 's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film . It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one !
1.0 This is the best movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I've seen the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 ( ? ) .<br /><br />That month they were showing a <unk> movie every Sunday night.<br /><br />The next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which I do n't remember . If you know it , please let me know ! In any case , how can I get to see this movie again ? ? ? ? A DVD of this movie , where ? ? Please tell me at <unk> /><br />The next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which I do n't remember . If you know it , please let me know ! In any case , how can I get to see this movie again ? ? ? ? A DVD of this movie , where ? ? Please tell me at <unk>
0.0 While I recently gave <unk> <unk> a positive review , I really did n't like this film even though it had so many similarities . Both were made just a few years apart , both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies . However , the overall tone and style of the films were quite different . KISS HER FOR ME , overall , just seemed like a cheaper film -- with poor writing , little energy and some VERY broad performances -- even when compared to <unk> <unk> . I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield . The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A - budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio . Plus , there was n't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant -- an actor generally loved for his grace and class . It 's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main .
1.0 The subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre . The latter seasons disastrous <unk> contributed to its three season short life span . Maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would 've gained a cult following.<br /><br />Aside from that , the first season was truly hilarious ! Witty , clever with superb writing it was promising . The first season 's excellent brew had the right ingredients - characters / actors , storyline and so forth . Plus a comedy about a <unk> reporter was original to boot . Nora and her fellow " photographers " on the prowl , night after night , day after day for the <unk> /><br />A lot of things do n't make sense to me . Like how this show , and another <unk> of mine - Gross Pointe never " made it " . If only the first seasons of the Naked Truth , and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD , please anyone out there ? !
1.0 Why did n't <unk> have any pants ? ! Where did they go ? ? It was never explained . That 's why this movie was so awesome . Plus Starsky gave his kids the AIDS ! ! ! ! Great acting too . Richard Dawson deserved to win Best Supporting Actor ! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was " That hit the spot " A I D S. This movie was for the " birds " . I tried to give this movie the " <unk> " but it continued playing . What am I doing wrong ? ? ? ! ! ! ! I thought the " <unk> " was <unk> lol ;) I would like that for a show . Why was n't <unk> wearing pants . I know his arm WAS <unk> but ... What 's up with those crazy <unk> <unk> . Why did n't that family feud guy Ray Combs get a net ? ? He could have used one . <unk>
0.0 In film , I feel as though it should be more than just art . I think it should be more than that , a way to tell a story on screen . This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one . I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy . It is good film - making but there really is n't anything else to it . As I 've said before , I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I do n't see a need for it at all . This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he 's still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future . If you like Lynch , check this out but do n't be surprised when you do n't like it very much .
1.0 The greatest games of <unk> or Fischer can be a mess for a total rookie . This is a great movie . There is no special agency involved in the plot . This is the clue ! This is a PRIVATE plot , built as a PRIVATE enterprise . This is a self - destructive and a self organized plot . As a conclusion , the scenario described the perfect professional plot : private , self <unk> , self - destructive , with no trace at the end . Anyone can be behind the plot : a smart " director " with some money . All can be done just by <unk> . The " director " must be just trigger . If the normal viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie , a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered . All the actors ' performances are well done , with some special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney .
1.0 This movie has <unk> horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like Dude Where s my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you . If your into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca i d have to <unk> you in a different angle . Yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of " <unk> " this is one of the few movies me and my <unk> have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible . GREAT MOVIE . This movie should the <unk> number 1 because its so friggin ' high class . The only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists . So i do nt know how to get this movie , i d like to buy it for dvd but i ca nt find it anywhere . I still have it taped from when it was first on , you can come over if you want and watch it <unk> i might be sleeping . this movie rocks and that s <unk> all you need to know .
0.0 I saw this when it was in the theater , it started out so strong I mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent AT THE time . Now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations , and other related psychological factors . Now as I said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining . It builds to an excellent climax then .... IT ends I mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it , besides being a very poetic description . In my experience , it was just not strong enough . My wife and I were well ... how can I say this ? We were upset , I mean we paid money , invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent . " We both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly . In fact my wife said it best , it did not end , IT JUST <unk> !
1.0 I love old Burt Reynolds movies . They 're funnier and better than every other movie combined . They might as well have stopped making movies after " <unk> Run 2 " , but I guess how could they have known that there were n't going to be any more good ones ? Man this movie 's good . Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a <unk> a lot , and the <unk> Loni Anderson is on hand , looking extremely hot in an <unk> way . Burt and Loni , those were the days ! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a <unk> cleaner . I sure loved that advertisement ! Plus there 's this one part in the movie where the audience at the <unk> is upset at something Stroker Ace ( <unk> R. ) is doing , and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment ! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night ! If you can find this movie , rent it ! And then never watch another movie again , because I tell you right now : there 's no point .
1.0 The year is 1964 . <unk> " Che " Guevara , having been a Cuban citizen for the last five years , disappears from the face of the Earth , leaving a <unk> Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead , when in truth , he has left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live an assumed identity . Whilst living in La Paz , Guevara <unk> an idea to overthrow the corrupt , bourgeois government there . Once again , Steven <unk> takes up where ' Che : Part One ' leaves off ( only better this time ) . The pacing is more on target , the job of acting is ever so fine ( including a turn by a sickly looking <unk> Del Toro , as Che Guevara ) . Suffice it to say , it 's probably best if you see both films , to get the true story of Guevara & what kind of a man he was ( I had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one <unk> about a long <unk> ! ) . As with ' Che - Part <unk> <unk> film has no MPAA rating , but contains enough <unk> language & violence to easily <unk> it an ' R ' .
1.0 I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was . I mean at first I was kinda expecting a cheesy , and predictable film , but I decided to put that aside when watching . Well , when it was over I was just left <unk> in tears ) , by how great The Man In The Moon turned out to be . This movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone , and its just a fabulous film . The acting was great especially from <unk> <unk> was so cute and lovable ) , and everyone else . There was n't anything that really bothered me , I felt the ending kinda predictable , but very well done at that . Also I felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before , but still a great film . Overall I must say I do n't to much to say about this film , not that it was bad , its just a film you either like or do n't like . I would however recommend this to any and everyone , even if you do n't like these type of films , its still an enjoyable film.<br /><br <unk> out of 10 stars
1.0 This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so I was hooked by the time the title came on . The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re - invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . The scenes in the chicken <unk> are spectacular . At one point <unk> ( who owns the chicken farm ) attends a <unk> in laughing , where he 's the worst student . His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day . There 's not a lot of plot here . <unk> the old man 's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . This movie appealed to me in the same way that <unk> did , although the characters could n't be more dissimilar .
1.0 Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing , albeit , completely corny , to adults . Not a bad film for a low - budget job . Children will be amazed with Santa 's <unk> and the " magic " that enables him to enter homes through <unk> that appear too small , or homes that have no <unk> at <unk> /><br />Kids will thrill over the Santa 's success at <unk> the nasty devil named Pitch ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail ! ) . They will sympathize with the poor little girl who 's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love . And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents . And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas ? In the end , everyone , including the nasty boys , get just what they deserve for <unk> /><br />The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world.<br /><br / >
0.0 I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor , so I gave it a chance , from director <unk> Jordan ( Buffalo Soldiers ) . Basically Ned Kelly ( Heath Ledger ) is set up by the police , especially <unk> Francis Hare ( Geoffrey Rush ) , he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family 's names . That 's really all I can say about the story , as I was n't paying the fullest attention to be honest . Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne , Naomi Watts as Julia Cook , Laurence <unk> as Dan Kelly , Philip <unk> as Steve Hart , Joel <unk> as Aaron <unk> , <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , Kerry <unk> as Kate Kelly , Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott . Ledger makes a pretty good performance , for what it 's worth , and the film does have it 's eye - catching moments , particularly with a gun battle towards the end , but I ca n't say I enjoyed it as I did n't look at it all . Okay !
1.0 <unk> mother - son - duo ( Alice Krige and Brian Krause ) sucks life - force of virgins , and their newest target is pretty but lonely Tanya ( <unk> Amick ) . However , these monsters are allergic to cat 's scratches ... I have never been fan of sleazy , overrated <unk> like King , <unk> or Barker , but this B - movie , written by Mr <unk> himself , is actually not near as bad than it could be . Yes , it is sometimes jaw - droppingly atrocious , but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches : good old - fashioned graveyard , eerie soundtrack and <unk> - Gothic - house - scene , mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains , etc . Of course , the film is polluted by Mr <unk> 's potty - mouthed dialogue and all - tactics - of - toilet - seat obsession to <unk> fat people , leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher , but there is roses among manure .
1.0 I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was , the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was . Well that was because it is n't supposed to be taken so seriously , basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job .. There seems to be another movie coming out like that too , umm ... Scary Movie ? ? Well this is Aussie , and original ! ! ! Jessica Napier does a <unk> performance and Sarah <unk> has a <unk> bright future in acting ! I hope to see more of them . Molly Ringwald was a good move , and Kylie was an even better move . The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen ! ! I recommend seeing this flick , as you 'll be guessing until the very end the connection with <unk> , Hilary and The movie that never got finished 20 years ago .
1.0 There seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net . Those who hate it and curse Ralph <unk> name and those love it and call it work of <unk> . I 'm inclined to be in the middle . <unk> forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film ( <unk> cruel cutting of the story , badly rotoscoped <unk> , over acting etc ... ) But <unk> this I still love this film . The rotoscoping ( when done <unk> an eerie <unk> dimension to the <unk> and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic . The surrealistic scenes when the <unk> chase Frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score ... magic . Sadly the bad points <unk> film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film.<br /><br <unk> doubt I 'll be <unk> by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review , ah well , such is life )
0.0 This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you do n't take it seriously . It is a bit dated and the effects are lame , but it is so enjoyable . There are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh , and the crabs sing Japanese . It is amazingly bad . And the ending , which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . Predictable , but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . Do n't even give this film a chance and you will love it . Susan George is fun to watch and yes , she does appear naked . Her daughter is n't quite worth putting up with , but she does get attacked by giant crabs . They are the size of large cats . This is a 2 , but I love it . As a movie , my God , but for entertainment , I give it a 7 . Did I mention there are giant crabs ?
1.0 Dr. Mordrid , what can I say ? Jeffrey Combs has done it again!<br /><br <unk> Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years waiting for Kabal , an evil sorcerer , to come so he can kill him . Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as kids , so Mordrid knows all Kabal 's <unk> /><br />The film as a little bit confusing at begin with , but soon you feel a part of the action . I wo n't give away the ending , so go and watch Doctor <unk> /><br />I found the film to be very enjoyable because it does n't have a lot of violence in , nor sexual scenes . The film focused on the plot and that 's what I like ! I find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by . This is because you are so engrossed in the film . Doctor Mordrid is a <unk> engrossing movie ! I give it a 20 out of 10 . Worth <unk> /><br / >
1.0 I did n't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes , but I found myself forgetting that it was n't the porn legend himself . In fact , the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under - rated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier , seek out the two - disc set and watch the " <unk> " documentary first ; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie . < br /><br />Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD . There are a number of reasons that it might have been included , one of which is that John Holmes ' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution . If you do n't want to see it , it 's easy to avoid ; it 's clearly identified as " LAPD Crime Scene <unk> " on the menu !
1.0 i 've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond . you 're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group <unk> which dates back to the beginning in 1988 , in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 , the band breaking up when <unk> left . which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and <unk> in 1991 . this story was somewhat based on that.<br /><br <unk> more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree , the way they explained the <unk> juice song to be a political statement was hilarious . not to mention the " love song " tasty was hooking up . and when vanilla <unk> got his ass kicked , just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they 're managers getting shot every time too.<br /><br <unk> who did n't enjoy this movie probably did n't get it or were complete idiots , my opinion
1.0 Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . The movie , was presented well , with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing . Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail <unk> . The progression of situations were cleverly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what I thought might be the obvious . Too bad there have to be commercials . I have told many friends to watch for further showings and I of course will view again . I enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue . <unk> and wife heated <unk> should I say fights ? ) were very realistic . The initial situation is a common one but the <unk> into the story presented fortunately is not . I want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film . Thank you ! Looking forward to the next films --- when ? <unk>
0.0 I viewed this movie in DVD format . My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD . I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani . While fun to watch , I feel she did n't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films . I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance . The other two actors I was n't very familiar with so I ca n't compare their performance , however they were fairly enjoyable also . The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion . The story line , while some could say slightly compelling , lacked direction . I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film . If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film , but otherwise leave it alone .
1.0 The Secret Fury , in many ways a run - of - the - mill romantic suspense drama ( directed by Mel Ferrer ) boasts top - notch principals in Colbert and Ryan ; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end , when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre . But for some viewers the film 's highlight will be the portrayal of <unk> Leah by Vivian Vance -- the immortal Ethel <unk> on " I Love Lucy . " Oddly , Vance had very few film roles ; her true home was Broadway , where ( among other <unk> ) she <unk> for Ethel <unk> . Here she contributes a winning turn as a <unk> <unk> to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme ; watch her half - heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she 's <unk> a <unk> cigarette in the hotel 's <unk> - storage room -- a <unk> for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty .
0.0 We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book , but this is exceptional . Important characters were cut out , <unk> and Alba were essentially <unk> into the same character , most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated . Clara 's clairvoyance was extremely <unk> , making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one I got to know in the book . In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people , which in turn was a key element in the life of the family . In the movie she was no more than some special lady . The relationship between Esteban and Pedro <unk> ( <unk> - <unk> , by the way , is the son and thus comes after <unk> - <unk> ) and its connections to that between Esteban and his grandson from <unk> <unk> ( not son , who he also did recognize ) is chopped in half and its importance <unk> /><br />One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of : this is called " The House of the Spirits . " Where is the house ? The story of 3 - 4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the " big house on the corner , " a line stated so many times in the novel . The house in fundamental to the story , but the movie unjustly <unk> it to a mere <unk> /><br />If I had n't read the book before , I would have never guessed that such a sappy , shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel .
1.0 Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman : Dead End that just helps stimulate our taste <unk> and leave us wanting more ! This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like ! Even tough this is a <unk> of sorts . The attention to detail , character and action is undeniably real . Although this is a limited resources production , it puts to shame big budgeted , star - casted , hyped productions " other " superhero related movies . Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people . Finally , a Superman that actually looks " super " and looks like the real thing ! Batman the way it should be , without the flashy rubber - casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny <unk> for over paid actors that do n't deliver . I just wish that some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel . I do n't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD , I would never get tired of watching it . Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this . Hope the " <unk> " at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look . No more " Batman & Robin " fiasco , or Hulk , Daredevil , etc . <unk> from these small time directors and learn that there should n't be any reason to " reinvent " the hero for the movie , just to have it " bomb " in theaters . Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you ! !
1.0 I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick " <unk> " . I was told that Devil 's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set . I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one , so my interest was <unk> /><br <unk> 's Experiment is a short film with no story , no character development . Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes . They torture her in various ways like beating her , spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol , forcing her to listen to hi - pitched noise for 24 hours , smash her hand with a <unk> , burning and putting maggots on the burns , throwing guts at her , and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.<br /><br />I must say that a lot of this movie was fake , like the beating scenes . But then , some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it . Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about . The worst is the eye scene . I did n't <unk> when watching it but simply thought " Damn , that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie " . I did enjoy the flick but I do n't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer . 7/10
1.0 There is this private <unk> in <unk> , Massachusetts , that 's been around since 1959 . My grandparents were among its <unk> , my parents had a site starting in 1965 , and my two brothers have sites there now.<br /><br <unk> does n't have anything directly to do with the movie ; bear with me . ) < br /><br />I spent summers at <unk> Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen , and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks : the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was , as my fiancée tells of me , " the good and happy place . " If you 've never experienced the lifestyle , Indian Summer will probably be lost on you ; do n't bother . It 's not quick - paced , it does n't have rapid cuts , the plots are n't in the least bit convoluted , it has no explosions , such dramatic tension as exists is mild , there are n't any A - list actors , there are no rapid - fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are ( other than , perhaps , <unk> Williams ' killer line about how her fiancé should n't " <unk> his toys . " That is not the least degree what this movie is about , any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore.<br /><br />But Indian Summer is Godfather 's polar opposite . If you have experienced the lifestyle , see this movie . Do n't read any more , just do it.<br /><br />For me , this is a 9/10 film .
1.0 NOTHING ( 3 + outta 5 stars ) Another weird premise from the director of the movie " Cube " . This time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void . There is literally NOTHING outside of their small two - story house . <unk> to be sure , but I thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get - go was extremely ill - conceived . There needs to be some humour , certainly ... and I have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes ( their final " showdown " was definitely a hoot ) ... but I really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning . After watching the movie I watched the " Making of " feature on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the " sillier " comedic aspects ... making it look like a completely different ( and slightly better ) movie . The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together ... similar in a way to the recent movie " <unk> . " The actors are fine when they are not <unk> the comedy shtick . They are really quite believable in their more " normal " moments . I was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point ... but it won me over by the end . ( And keep watching past the credits for the final scene ... just do n't ask me to explain it . )
0.0 Hello . this is my first review for any movie i have seen . i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally , the most disgusting movie i have ever seen . I feel like the movie was <unk> made , which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it . I felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw . Which i can agree , saw as well is also very graphic , but , i did like the movie <unk> /><br />The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen . the scene lasted almost forever , well actually , it was probably around 5 min but still . i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good . this director <unk> <unk> , and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one . one final note haha ! ! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY <unk> <unk> <unk> TO DEATH , <unk> <unk> , WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AND A FIVE <unk> <unk> OF SOMEONE <unk> THERE HEAD <unk> IN WITH A <unk> then you will enjoy this movie , if not , and you like horror , go with a higher budget film , like saw for example . I ca nt believe people actually make movies like this . anyway sorry to anyone who loves <unk> <unk> and took it to heart , this is just my opinion on the movie .
